Candaules,
 King 
of
 Lydia,
 Shews 
his
 Wife 
by 
Stealth
 to 
Gyges,
 One
 of
 his
 Ministers, 
as
 She
 Goes
 to
 Bed
 is
 a
 painting
 by
 English 
artist
 William
 Etty,
 first
 exhibited
 at
 the
 Royal
 Academy
 in
 1830.
 It
 shows
 a
 scene
 from
 the
 Histories
 by
 Herodotus,
 in
 which
 Candaules, 
king
 of
 Lydia,
 invites
 his
 bodyguard 
Gyges
 to
 hide
 in
 the
 couple's
 bedroom
 and
 watch
 his
 wife
 Nyssia
 undress.
 After
 Nyssia
 notices
 Gyges,
 he
 kills
 Candaules
 and
 takes
 his 
place
 as 
king.
 The
 painting
 shows
 the
 moment
 at 
which
 Nyssia,
 unaware
 of
 Gyges
, removes 
the
 last 
of 
her
 clothes. 
Etty
 hoped 
to 
impart
 the
 moral 
that
 women
 are
 not 
chattels 
and 
that
 men
 violating 
their
 rights
 should 
be 
punished,
 but
 he 
made
 little
 effort
 to 
explain
 this
 to
 audiences. 
The 
painting 
was
 immediately
 controversial,
 seen
 as
 a 
cynical
 combination 
of 
pornography
 and
 a 
violent 
unpleasant 
narrative,
 and
 critics
 condemned
 it
 as
 an
 immoral
 work
 of
 the
 type
 they
 would
 not
 expect
 from
 a
 British
 artist.
 In
 1929
 it
 was
 among
 several
 artworks
 transferred
 to
 the
 newly
 expanded
 Tate
 Gallery,
 where
