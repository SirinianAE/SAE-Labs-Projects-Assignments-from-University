    "Στην άσκηση αυτή θα εξασκηθείτε στην εφαρμογή αλγορίθμων κατηγοριοποίησης.\n",
    "\n",
    "O στόχος σε αυτή την άσκηση είναι να διαχωρίσετε μεταξύ επιχειρήσεων που ανήκουν στις κατηγορίες ‘Nightlife’, ή ‘Bars’, και τις επιχειρήσεις που ανήκουν στις κατηγορίες ‘Cafes’, ‘Coffee & Tea’, ή ‘Breakfast & Brunch’. Θα  δουλέψετε  με  τις  επιχειρήσεις  από  την  περιοχή  του  Τορόντο.  Δημιουργήστε  τα  δεδομένα με  τις επιχειρήσεις, και εξάγετε χαρακτηριστικά από το κείμενο των reviews των επιχειρήσεων, καθώς και όποια άλλα χαρακτηριστικά πιστεύετε μπορούν να βοηθήσουν. Θα πειραματιστείτε με τέσσερεις classifiers: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision  Trees,και Naïve Bayes. Για την αξιολόγηση θα χρησιμοποιήσετε 5-fold cross validation. Αναφέρετε τον μέσο confusion matrix και τις μετρικές accuracy, precision, recall και F1-measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Στην  αναφορά  σας  περιγράψετε  τα  χαρακτηριστικά  που  χρησιμοποιήσατε,  και  τα  αποτελέσματα  της κατηγοριοποίησης. Εξετάσετε επίσης τη  σημασία  που  δίνουν  στα διάφορα χαρακτηριστικά οι κατηγοριοποιητές (π.χ., τα βάρη που έχουν στον logistic regression classifier, ή τα πρώτα επίπεδα του decision tree), και προσπαθήστε να καταλάβετε ποιες λέξεις είναι που ξεχωρίζουν τις δύο κατηγορίες.

Small but comfortable atmosphere. \\nGate 403 brings in wonderful jazz talent and they promote young talent. \\nKeep up the great job!', \"A very talented and musical friend of mine was playing a jazzy show here and I rarely if ever pass up an invite to hear live music. Almost every day of the week at Gate 403 you'll be sure to happen upon a few local jazz artists or bands who are simply playing their music for the love of it. Not only do I find this endearing, I also think it's perfect for those who wish to support local talent in Toronto. \\n\\nWhile Gate 403 is not a large space, it fits a nice crowd of people who are either there for the food or for the music. Both are safe bets if you ask me. Gate 403 is a mix between a pub and a piano bar and it seems to have something for everyone. Come in for the food and stay for the tunes, either way you'll be happy you filled your ears and of course, your belly.\", 'Let me be clear, you come here for the music and vibe--not the food or service. Casual drinks or a date its a great spot. However, if you are planning on having dinner this is not the place. Very few waitstaff so the service is slow, even when they are around they are not attentive. Who brings over two waters for a table of four? food is typical bar fare and it is mediocre at best. If this place didnt have live music I really couldnt see a reason to come here unless i was desperate for a pint.', 'Very cool bar with great live  jazz music, the servers r nice & nice selection of beer on tap', 'Awesome place!! I used to basically live here Tuesday nights for Julian Fauth!\\n\\nI held a business christmas party here and was taken care of BIG TIME!!!\\n\\nlove the owner, barmaids and everything about this place...\\n\\nCalamari?? meh....its better for booze and tunes...']\n",

No flyers, they don't accept coupons, they are getting the most money from you possible\\n\\n- Their selection sucks. I have been there many times that they've had no ground beef. COME ON! Ground beef?! Really they just don't have enough of anything! \\n\\n- Their deli service is questionable. One of the workers scares me a little! I haven't seen him around recently though, so maybe they figured out he scares the customers\\n\\n- The cashiers are touch and go. There are two (I think they owners) who are really abrupt and unfriendly. Then there are two younger people who are super friendly and personable. If you have a choice, go to a younger cashier! \\n\\n- Cleanliness - not sure if anyone else has noticed this, but this place never seems fully clean... \\n\\nSo, if you have an opportunity to get a drive to Metro, do it. The sales there will also be better priced than Freshmart, which makes it worth the journey.

After we sat down, a mob of people came in and almost half of the restaurant was filled! After we were seated, we took a quick glance at the menu and decided what to order. Our waitress was very attentive and took our orders promptly. I went with the Nagasaki Champon (Seafood) and my girlfriend went with \"The Kings of the Kings Ramen\" (she\\'s so fancy)! I also ordered the Matcha Green Tea Smoothie. \\n\\nMy green tea smoothie took about 10 minutes to come out and it was kind of too bland for me. It had a milky but not too sweet green tea taste. It was good, but just not my kind of drink. Our food came out probably around 15 minutes after we ordered it, which isn\\'t too bad. My seafood ramen was awesome, mostly because I love seafood and the soup base tasted great. It came with a decent amount of seafood (Shrimp, scallops, and mussels) and noodles. One minor complaint I have is that the shrimp should be unshelled, this makes it easier to eat especially when eating ramen...or maybe I\\'m just picky! As for my girlfriend (she\\'s a picky eater), she thought that it was just okay. They could have gave less toppings, primarily the bean sprouts because it seemed like there were more of that than noodles. Another thing is that she didn\\'t like the smokey flavor of the pork, but that depends on your taste. One thing that we both agree on is that the noodles had a great texture to it, it was an awesome smooth and soft texture.\\n\\nAs for the service, I thought our waitress did a great job. She accommodated with our requests and was very attentive. She came back often enough to not annoy us, but enough for us to request items if we needed. Our ramens didn\\'t come out quick, but it wasn\\'t so long that we would complain. We also got a coupon for 5$ off 25$ the next time we visit :)\\n\\nOverall, I had a great time and meal at Kenzo.

I agreed, and she brought into one of their rooms. It was not particularly luxurious - old chairs, open doorways, and half walls between the rooms. They brought in a bucket of warm water which had a tea bag in it, then left me to soak my feet. I appreciated that she brought me the wifi password, although it could have been because I had asked if they had wifi prior to agreeing to the service.

He dried my feet / legs and began to slather them with vaseline and got to work.\\n\\nOverall, I would say my experience was mediocre. It was only my second foot massage, but it was not as good as my first.

The massage itself probably lasted around 35 minutes, so I was in and out in about 45 minutes. At the end, my feet and legs were a greasy mess, so I asked the lady if I could soak them again. For some reason she said that I couldn't, but offered me a warm wet towel instead. I took her up on this and she wiped down my legs for me. It was only when I was leaving that I was offered water or tea. This was a bit odd to me as I would have liked to enjoy those during the actual massage.\\n\\nGiven that there are so many other similar places in Chinatown that offer the 60 minute foot massages for $30, I will try another option before returning to Zhen Zhen.\",\n",

I think she actually got my back to crack. I\\'m only deducting one star for the fact I was in there a little over an hour and the deal should have been an hour and a half.  They had tried to up sell by telling us about getting a longer body massage if our backs were hurting that would be better so I kinda thought when we went in for the body part they would make up the 15 min.

However, the spa itself is noisy, both within and from the noise upstairs.  The Turkish bath/massage is a joke compared to the experience you get in an actual Turkish style bath/massage (and I have had in Turkey, as well as Morocco and Budapest).   \\n\\nI am giving Hammam Spa one star though because of their repeated poor customer service and condescending and arrogant attitude.  \\n\\nFirst, you cannot get through to anyone at their phone number - you are directed to the website or you can leave a message.  That is not helpful customer service.     \\n\\nSecond, on several occasions, I have left a message and have never received a return call.  That is not helpful customer service.  \\n\\nThird, their specials are highly misleading.  For example, their January 2014 special says \"20% off any service when you book online...use promo code 2014\".  I purchased a gift certificate online for two specific massages and entered the promo code.  I understood the special would have applied to this, especially since the online purchase page had a box where the promo code could be entered (which I entered).  The 20% was not taken off the purchase price.  I left two voicemail messages for Hammam Spa asking them to call me back to give me a credit for the difference.  I never heard back from them.  Finally, after I had to email them (again, it is not helpful customer service if I have to spend a large amount of time chasing you down) Hammam Spa called me back today to say that gift certificates purchased online are not covered by this special, notwithstanding I was purchasing gift certificates for services.  I suggested to her that the special should specifically set out in the future that it does not apply to purchases of gift certificates for specific services and I believe she agreed that would be helpful (duh!).  I asked if there was anything she could do for me to which she repeated that gift certificates are not available.  Her tone was arrogant and her refusal to do anything reinforces for me that Hammam Spa has very poor customer service and a condescending and arrogant attitude.  \\n\\nFor these reasons, I will not use Hamman Spa in the future personally nor purchase gifts for others there.   I urge everyone to instead consider all of the fine spas in and around Toronto other than Hamman Spa: http://www.blogto.com/toronto/the_best_spas_in_toronto/.',\n",

Check in process was smooth. Upon check in we were given a quick tour of the facilties as it was our first time. The locker and shower areas were clean and in immaculate condition. \\n\\nFor the hammam treatment, we first used the steam room. By far one of the best steam rooms, I have ever been to. It has nice soft lighting which chnages with the music. Yes the steam room has music!! What I loved most was the bowl of ice and washcloths that are provided for you to take inside the steam room if you need to cool down a little. \\n\\nIt was then followed by our Turkish bath. The ladies that helped my husband and me were very professional and did an amazing job. The marble stone remained hot and we were never uncomfortable/ awkward at any time. What I loved the most was the couples turkish bath is on the same slab of stone, which allows you to hold hands, talk and actually enjoy the experience together as a couple. It was a really fun experience for us. After the baths, we could either relax in the tea are or use the steam room again. Both me and my husband were extremely happy with our scrub downs, our skin has never felt softer and cleaner.\\n\\nThe tea area is nice and cozy and has plenty of magazines, juices, water, tea, nuts, cranberries, fruit for use between your sessions. It has a nice fire place as well where you can sit and relax with your tea. \\n\\nAs mentioned earlier, the showers were nice and clean, they have plenty of towels, bathrobes and sarongs if you need to change them out. They also have basic things like hair bands, deodrant, hair spray and hair brushes.  The only one thing I wish they had were better hair driers but that was no big deal. \\n\\nOverall, we both loved our visit to hammam spa and would definitely book a bath again.

       "  'I\\'ve been to Hammam Spa 3 times now, all of which have been during promotions (they have new ones every month) and for facials. I have a hard time justifying paying the full premium here vs. a joint like Pure + Simple, as well as not just paying an extra $20 or so bucks to go to a nicer spa in the neighbourhood (e.g. at the Ritz or Shangri La).\\n\\nHammam is pleasant. It\\'s a nice little retreat at the northwest corner of King and Portland, with little being the operative word. The amenities are limited to a tea room and their steam room, or \"hammam\". All amenities are available to men and women. You are provided a wrap, a robe and flip flops in the locker room, to walk around in. I would recommend wearing a bathing suit underneath if you want to use the steam room, as the alternative is spending the rest of your time there in a damp wrap.\\n\\nThe tea room can comfortably seat perhaps 10 people, before it starts to feel cramped. There are apples / dried cranberries / almonds to snack on, and water, juice and tea, alongside a selection of predominantly lifestyle magazines. The star attraction, the hammam, is of a similar scale and is included in your stay if you spend over $100. Otherwise, I believe the charge is closer to $50 for entrance, which is not justified in my humble opinion. 2 out of the 3 times I was here, the face towels in the ice bowl outside the steam room were completely depleted (literally was a bowl of ice with a sign saying \"enjoy\"). Sometimes there are big towels available for you to lie on, depending on your luck. The hammam is eucalyptus scented and quite hot, but not very relaxing given the side conversations which always seem to be happening in there. It\\'s no fault of the spa, but it\\'s hard to zen out when you can hear the couple beside you talking about the coworker they hate.\\n\\nThere are no clocks anywhere (which can be stressful for type As...). Your attendant will come find you when it\\'s time for your appointment. The treatment rooms are nice, and the facials I had were fine. I prefer the dermalogica facial over the skincetuicals (which was more mask-oriented). To be honest, I\\'ve received better \"extras\" (e.g. the hand / foot / shoulder massage) at cheaper places like Pure + Simple. I am 80% sure that during one of my treatments, when a mask was left on, I received a brisk scalp massage and then could hear the cosmetologist texting. . . I digress. What I do like about Hammam, is that they have never pushed product on me (contrary to some other reviews I have read).\\n\\nBottom line: a little bit more \"spa like\" than your standard no-frills joint, but not even close to the range and scale of amenities available if you pay a little extra (or even a little less at the Elmwood Spa, which offers a hot tub and a pool). 4 stars, because there is nothing offensive about the experience to deserve lower.',\n",

When we got there (2:00pm) hardly anyone was around so our expectation was that it would be a nice and quiet afternoon.  \\n\\nWe changed and headed to the steam room.

As we waited in the tea room for our treatments, this is where I was most disappointed.  You could hear people walking across the floor from overhead.  It was loud and continuous.  Then there were random guys dressed in street clothes that kept walking by.  They obviously weren't there for treatments and looked like construction workers.

As other reviews have mentioned, the customer service needs a little work.  As first time visitors a health form was required to be completed before the massage.  We completed the form and we were shown to the waiting area.  We were confused as usually you get into a robe and slippers before a massage.  We asked again and the woman who showed us in told us she thought we were there for pedicures.  Seemed strange but however....

The shower door frames had clearly been welded backtogether following a failure; but the sloppy weld job and exposed cracked tiles were signs that this place needs some serious investment. The hot water suddenly ceased to flow during the shower, leaving me in fridgid water for about a minute; pleasant! The shower faucet was covered in some kind of grease or gunky soap scum.

I feel like my tiny RMT was overwhelmed by the amount of effort requried to work out my kinks... perhaps my fault for not requesting someone stronger. You do not get to choose your music (Bob Marley covers done with a sitar?) nor your massage oil. The RMT was nice enough to to bring water / tea at the end of the massage. \\n\\nThe co-ed steam bath is ok?

Though during check out, only one staff member was present and apparently she was getting and earful on the phone from the owner.

Well, not in a rude way, because I maintain spa etiquette but if you go to the spa with a friend, you tend to chat.... Anyway....\\n\\nMy best gal pal and I went to Hammam on the weekend because my hubby got me a gift card for Christmas. Hey, I spend my days chasing around our busy little 11 month old. I deserve it. He booked a Turkish bath for me and a signature pedicure so my friend booked the same and we requested a couples room for our bath so that we could do it together, which is more fun. \\n\\nI\\'ve been to spas before, but of course, but never a Turkish one. It\\'s very pretty inside but if you look closely, you can sorta see the \"basement-y\" thing going on. The change room was excellent, very clean with everything you need there for your skin and hair if you forgot. Great plush robes and slippers are included. The spa has a pleasant scent as well, very incense-y. We hit the steam room and it was WAY way WAY WAAAAAY too hot for me. I\\'m not one for heat intensity like that but my friend convinced me to not turn around and walk right out so we sat down (and were probably \"chatty bitches\" at this point) and it wasn\\'t too bad. Until the light turned red. They have this slowly flashing colored light, blue, green, yellow and then red. The red is AWFUL! It literally makes me you feel like you\\'re in some kind of inferno! NOT RELAXING!!! Then my friend joked that a serial killer could lock us in there and that\\'d be it and that was it for me! Buh bye steam room! It\\'s just extremely hard to breathe in there. Good to warm up in, that\\'s for sure.\\n\\nWe started our bath. They had us lay down together on a marble slab. It felt great, very relaxing but both of our backs started aching from laying on the hard stone. They splashed us with water from bowls for an hour and then did a scrub, then soap, then finished with oil. It was definitely a fun experience but I can splash water on myself at home. For much cheaper than what this cost. But, overall, it was cool, fun, and felt good. \\n\\nNext they took us to the tea room and gave us some snacks--dates and halva. Apparently the snacks are only for the people who do the bath. We had some yummy tea and I started to get colder, and colder... and colder.... it was VERY chilly after being in the heat. Not so good. They did not time manage well and we ended up waiting probably 45 min between procedures. That\\'s ok if you\\'re not pressed for time. \\n\\nI have to give the pedicure 1 star. That\\'s it. It kinda sucked. My friend\\'s pedi also sucked. \\n\\nIt was $75 and the Vietnamese nail salon that normally does my nails did a 100 times better for 1/3rd of the price. They didn\\'t do much for the skin on my feet here though the paraffin was ok. She barely did the foot massage. For that amount of money, I expected more. The polish selection is excellent and she applied well but my friend\\'s polish didn\\'t dry! We sat under the dyers for a good 40 minutes and her\\'s was still sticky and they ended up giving her 50% off the price. \\n\\nOverall my experience was positive was but not extraordinary. We had a great time and felt great afterwards too but the day cost about $250 (including tip) per person and we only had two treatments. I didn\\'t feel it was worth that price at all. It\\'s certainly not bad here but certainly not amazing. 3/5 stars, middle of the road. I would probably not go back unless I got another gift card in which case I\\'d definitely try a facial and massage instead. I must compliment the staff here in general though because they are very friendly, very accomodating and they make you feel like a queen, no matter what treatment you\\'re doing. Everyone who interacted with us was very, very nice.\\n\\nOh and BIG THUMBS DOWN for not being wheelchair-accessible. That\\'s inexcusable.',\n",

The staff are pretty meh.\\nThey ask you to change in a very nice clean changeroom and then you sit in a side room where they have self-serve tea/coffee, cucumber sandwiches and fruit.  It was alright.\\nWe tried the steam room but I have to say that was the most UNENJOYABLE steam room possible. It was super dark, SUPER hot and impossible to see more than an inch in front of you.  YES, I UNDERSTAND how steam rooms work.  But this one was just ridiculous.  I felt like this was a horror movie and I was going to be attacked any second.

Honestly..someone could have been having sex RIGHT beside me and I wouldnt\\' have known becuase it was SOOOO dark in there.\\nThen we were introduced to our masseuses and they were very gracious.  \\nThe massage was ok but nowhere during the time that I lied down to the end did he ask me how it was going or what type of pressure I enjoyed.  The entire experience was PAINful.  If you enjoy deep tissue massacres I would highly suggest this place.

And I love people who plan.  But it was just a poor choice if you knew me....\\n\\nSo I went along with it.\\n\\nHe booked a special lunch at the spa w/ different gourmet coffee and coffee inspired food.  \\nThen he booked a coffee scrub for me and a seaweed wrap for himself.  \\nI looked it up and it seems like they were 120 and 140 respectively.\\nWe had a huge convo about \"detoxing\" etc etc and thought it would be a fun treat- I got to enjoy my own room and it was nice and soothing, although I must say that the rooms themselves are nothing special except for clean, dimly lit rooms with a lot of White.\\n\\nThe coffee scrub was incredibly uncomfortable and confusing.  I have never got a fully body treatment where they lather you up in types of edible or inedible things that you have to promise NOT to eat..but this experience was just as bad as you might imagine for someone who hates spas and general touching.\\n\\nThe smell was divine but basically I felt like I was a baby resisting bath time and, honestly...was even kind of squirming around like a baby with my limbs resisting the treatment.\\nThe person wasn\\'t especially chatty and wanted to like, put me in some sort of yoga-zone w/ stupid \"eastern\" music that made me want to write an additional chapter of Said\\'s Orientalism...\\nThe entire thing ended quite unceremoniously with me w/ me wanting to take a shower.\\n\\nnever again, Hammam spa..never again',\n",

I was told fairly rudely that my service was at 130pm to which I replied I thought it was at 1pm, no one had told me differently...to which I was told to go sit down and wait. I asked that they tell my friend, who had a massage at 1pm and would be done at 2pm, that I\\'d be a half hour later, to which they said no problem and then did nothing about.\\n\\nLike I said, the actual facial was incredible but when I went to pay a young woman at the front asked me how my time was and I admitted I was a little annoyed that the time of my service had been messed up... that\\'s when this blonde woman (not dressed in their traditional black so perhaps she is a manager, in which case she should be fired for not knowing how to speak to clients) started barking at me that \"she remembered taking the appointment and it was at 130pm....\"  and so on...to which I said ok and that I felt that she was attacking me, but in return did not receive apology from her or anything after her uncalled for outburst.

I  was distraught for the rest of the day, unsure why this \"manager\" or whoever she was would yell at me as she did when my visit was to relieve myself of stress not be treated to more. \\n\\nThere are many good places to get a facial in the city and unfortunately after this experience and being treated so rudely by the front desk staff, one woman in particular, there is no reason why I would return.',\n",

I did notice that the length of times that your service provider left for you to change and to dispense products were normal periods of time for the service provider to leave, 2 minutes to get settled into the room and 4 minutes to dispense product. I understand that it can feel like a longer stretch of time. I did double check and the overall treatment time was 53 minutes. The facial is listed as a 60 minute service but there are a few variable minutes depending on the clients skincare needs.\\n \\nRegarding your concern about missing the hand massage and hot towels I will share your feedback with the service provider when she returns tomorrow in order to discuss improvements.\\n \\nThank you again for your feedback.\\n \\nSincerely,\\n \\nVictoria\",\n",

Let me tell you that massage was heaven! I got a full body massage by a male RMT (forgot his name) and he gave me the best, most relaxing massage of my life! As for the Turkish bath, omg, my skin is still super soft and hydrated from it four days later. I've never had one before so it was a new experience for me. You basically have do lay down on a marble table looking thing and the lady will dump water all over your body, followed by an exfoliation of the whole body, then puts these huge bubbles on you (this part is really cool), and then rubs you down with black soap, and finally, pours water on you again. After that you turn around on your stomach so she can repeat the same process for the back. My lady's name was really nice (I believe her name is Michelle, sorry I forgot again). And I don't want to forget the steam room--it's definitely the biggest and most beautiful steam room I've ever been in. The relaxing coloured lighting and the smell of aromatic scents  really sets the tone and relaxes you; just don't forget to stay hydrated. As I mentioned early my skin is so soft still! Like I don't even have to wear any lotion so my skin won't dry up and crack, it's just that hydrated. \\n\\nAnd while waiting in between each service there is a tea room which is basically a lounge area where you can sip on tea or lemon water and fruit juice, and munch on snacks such as apples, almonds, cranberries. There is also a bunch of magazines to choose from that you can read to kill time. \\n\\nThis is a luxury I definitely could get used to once a month. I'd definitely come back and I'd be happy to recommend this place to anyone looking for a couple hours of relaxation\",\n",

       "  \"This place seems quite polarizing based on previous Yelp reviews, so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I came here mainly wanting to check out the hammam experience. This place has been around for a long time, but I never came before because the prices seemed way too high. But they are offering 20% off all online booking this month, so I decided to use my insurance RMT benefits and try it out. A 60 mins. Swedish massage came to $112 instead of $140. Yes, it's expensive but with any service over $100 you get free access to the hammam.\\n\\nI had a really relaxing experience here, despite it being a busy Saturday. There were a lot of people but it somehow never felt crowded, I never had to wait for a shower, and there was always room to sit in the tea lounge. There were a few instances were people were talking loudly in the changeroom, but generally, I found it much quieter and more relaxing than Body Blitz. It's also nice that it's co-ed (but it means you have to wear either a bathing suit or the wrap they give you... I brought my swimsuit because I think the wrap would still be kinda risque).\\n\\nFrom start to finish, the service was excellent. I was given a walk around of the place and the facilities are really clean. Staff were constantly walking around clearing used towels, empty cups, etc. Everything smells amazing too! Eucalyptus oil everywhere... The change rooms have lockers and you can set the code (i.e. no having to keep track of a key). They provide robes (which are enormous, but I have never found a spa where they have small size robes) and slippers (which thankfully come in S/M/L/XL). There are rain showers and all the basics -- blow dryers, hair straightener, body lotion. But bring your own hairbrush. \\n\\nAfter taking a shower, I went to the steam room. It was a lot larger than I expected. It is very steamy and you can barely see in front of you, but there's lots of room to sit and enjoy. It might be too hot for some people, but I loved it. I have been to hammams in Europe before and this was similar. In the hammam area, there are also showers to rinse off, a fridge with cool towels and cucumber water, and 2 suites (for if you buy a package that includes gommage scrub). I went back and forth between the steam room and the tea lounge (which has hot and iced tea, fruit, and magazines). You don't need to watch the time for your booked service, because once you arrive the staff know you are in the facility so they will call your name either in the steam room or the lounge. I thought that was nice, but it still would've been useful to have a clock somewhere. \\n\\nMy massage was with Connie, and it was great. Some people find the service rooms noisy (you can hear people walk by), but I was in a room that was farther away and it was fine. Connie checked in a few times to make sure the pressure was good. I didn't have any particular area of focus, but found the massage really relaxing and almost fell asleep... The massage table is heated too, which was nice. \\n\\nOverall, this was a great escape in the middle of the city and the only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because it is so expensive (I wish we had a hammam experience in Toronto that was more social and affordable enough that one could go regularly). But it is definitely a nice treat!\",\n",

Plus, I\\'m a big spa junky.  \\n\\nI booked my DERMALOGICA CUSTOM FACIAL online. Super convenient, and I could even request a reminder via SMS. Great. \\n\\nI arrived 15 minutes early, and opted out of the unisex Turkish bath room. \\nI was guided to the change room by an uninterested girl who worked the front desk. She pointed at a locker at the very entrance of the change room and told me I could undress, and then go wait in the tea room. I had to ask where the tea room was. This was my first visit, which she was aware of, as she asked me when I checked in. \\n\\nThe change room was noisy, and cold. and there was NO privacy. There\\'s a circular seating cushion thing in the centre of the change room, and then rows of lockers.  I tried to back up into a corner to remove my clothing, just to get a bit of privacy,  and then realized I was backing up into a full length wall mirror. Awesome.  \\nI slipped on a massive, one sized fits no-one robe, and then realized I didn\\'t know where the flip flops were. ARE there flip flops?! I asked a naked lady in the change room, and she showed me where they were. \\n\\nI wandered out of the change room (with very little under my robe), and realized I was standing in the main hallway, steps away from the reception. More, open, and COLD. I quickly walked down the hallway in the opposite direction, hoping I was going to the right spot, and found the tea waiting room. It reminded me of a nicer VIP lounge at an airport. Circular chairs, with magazines. They had a set up of boiling water, and tea .. and water, glasses, ect. \\nI just sat there. Waiting. For what? I wasn\\'t even sure yet. I just hoped they hadn\\'t forgotten about me ...\\n\\nOut popped a very loud lady from behind a partition,  who turned out to be the one doing my facial. Her name was Tanya. **Word of the wise, don\\'t get TANYA if you don\\'t like LOUD TALKERS. :(\\nShe shook my hand, introduced herself, and I followed to my treatment room. I was disappointed of the location of the rooms. They\\'re at the end of the noisy, drafty hallway. I could very clearly hear people chatting and talking that were in the tea room, and even at one point, heard laughing from the reception area. \\nThis is a very busy spa. Very high traffic.   \\nI heard lots of flip flops and people chatting & giggling as they passed our treatment room, heading to other rooms. Again, noisy and distracting. It also didn\\'t help that my facial lady left the room 3 times. I\\'m really detail oriented, and I couldn\\'t help but time her \\'departures\\'. The first she left, she was gone for 11 minutes. The 2nd time, 8 minutes, the 3rd, 10 minutes. She didn\\'t tell me she was leaving, nor WHY she was leaving. I\\'d hear the door open and then slam shut. Damn. I\\'m laying on that table, pretty much naked with a sheet covering barely my boobs, and she\\'s opening and closing the door ... people passing by, and a draft of cold entering the room each time.\\n \\nShe put some stuff on my face (again, she didn\\'t tell me anything) and when she didn\\'t talk to me, she asked me what I did about those \\'black hairs\\' on my chin. Lovely. Way to be sensitive.  She told she forgot her tweezers, so she couldn\\'t remove them. I had NO blackheads for her to remove. Literally, nothing to squeeze. Hm .... \\n\\nShe did another wash, and she was really rough. By the end of my facial, my little nose ring was all red from the tugging and pulling she didn\\'t even seem to realize she was doing. It actually really freakin\\' hurt. She was whipping her hands around in a sloppy application. The mask she did ended up in the corners of my mouth. She had no idea, and I had to use the edge of the sheet to get it out of my mouth. \\n\\nMaybe I\"ve been REALLY REALLY REALLY spoiled by the beautiful facials I get at my usual place, but it made me realize what a difference a sensitive touch can make. At one point, she was moving around, running water harshly, flipping around her flip flops .. I had no idea what the hell she was doing, but I literally jumped because she put something on my face and I had no idea she was at my head again. UGH. Not relaxing. \\n\\nWhen she did talk, it was to tell me about the mask I was getting for free, promo of the month, and in the same breathe, she started telling me I should book another appointment with her in 3-4 weeks for one of the $75 treatments. WTF. I wasn\\'t even done my facial. I have to emphasize, this lady was LOUD. Really really loud. And she kept repeating the costs of everything.

We had a couple massage, I had an aromatherapy and my partner had a deep tissue. Even upon a little instruction by us the RMTs failed to adjust their styles - frustrating. This is especially annoying when the place charges WAY more than it should for massages. Is this a cash cow kind of place?t\\nAnother star off, The place is terribly used for space.

Its a shame I\\'m paying their staff and rent and getting such a non-hammam experience.  \\n\\nI give one star because simply it exists as a spa place and some of the staff were friendly.

The spa is very clean without looking sterile, nicely decorated, and the music is just loud enough that you can listen if you want or tune it out. The used towels and wraps are taken away and fresh towels stocked every few minutes, but unobtrusively. The steam room was quite hot, but it was relaxing and warmed my muscles nicely before the massage. I had reservations about a steamy room with multicoloured LEDs, but it wasn't too psychedelic, and I actually found it pleasant and calming having the light gently shift in color in the room. There was enough steam that you could just see across the room, so I don't think a previous reviewer's worry that people could have sex is too serious (the room isn't that big, and you'd be able to hear, too :P). The wall with the door is all glass, so I didn't feel claustrophobic the way I have when I've tried to used enclosed wooden steam rooms/saunas.\\n\\nAfter a while (with a short break for cold cucumber and orange water outside the steam room), the therapist came to the steam room, and my boyfriend and I were instructed to cool off in the showers and towel off. They then led us to the suite where couples massages take place. Each therapist spoke to us and figured out what we wanted (you can get any type of massage they offer within the couples massage, so if one person wants deep tissue and the other wants hot stone, that's okay). They left the room, we took off our robes, hopped under the blankets on the beds, and almost fell asleep just laying there for the therapists because we were already so relaxed.\\n\\nMy therapist was Amir, and wow. I have always felt sore the day after a massage, and a massage therapist friend has told me that means you weren't warmed up for the level of work done. I feel NO PAIN after this massage, but my back and neck felt amazing after the massage (I've already ruined it by carrying heavy things, so the tension is back, but no muscle pain from being worked on!). He was very good about checking in on how things felt, if I felt tenderness in certain spots, and if the work he'd done was sufficient or if I still felt tension or pain in an area. I was a bit confused when he did things like lift back my shoulder and just hold it for a minute or two, which I had never had a therapist do before, but OMG, the tension was gone after. He worked on my sore, stiff neck until the last possible moment to try to get the tension to ease up. I felt very well taken care of. He did give me a little reminder to work on my posture for improvement in neck issues, which wasn't the most spa-like, but also made me feel like I was being treated by an actual trained therapist who wants me to not be in pain, which I prefer to just relaxing and then going back to being in pain.\\n\\nAfter the massage, we went back to the team room. I don't think they'll kick you out until closing if you really want to stay there and hang out. After the steam, we showered in the changing room showers, where they had soap, shampoo, and conditioner. They also have a variety of hair styling products, lotion, hair ties, q-tips, two hair driers (one with various defusers for different types of hair), and feminine products, just in case. I discovered that I'd forgotten the combination I'd set on the keypad locker with my things in it, but they were very friendly and just opened it up for me, no problems. Payment was fast, and we both were able to pay separately (same price per person for a couples massage as two separate massages) and get receipts for insurance. The service wasn't pushy, and you can pay the therapist a tip in cash with a little envelope or as part of the credit card transaction.\\n\\nOverall, it was a really great experience, and I plan to do it again soon.\",\n",

Moving on, when we finally went into the steam, which is normally my favourite part, it stunk so incredibly bad. It smelled like someone with bad BO on the subway.  \\n\\nMy massage, however, was amazing.  No complaints there.  But afterwards, when we went to relax in the relaxation room and to have some tea, they were out of tea.  They were just not restocking anything.  When spending $150 + tip (so $180 for a 1 hour massage), I expect to have a smooth process from start to finish.  And it was just a flop.\\n\\nThere are other spas in the city - I think I'll explore those ones.\",\n",

Although I found the 60min Swedish massage to be more expensive than other all-inclusive spas (and ones with pools) they do provide nice amenities like the eucalyptus towels and mixed waters.\\n\\nSo why the poor review? It's due to a poor choice by the owners - they facilities are in a partially below grade, basement of an old building. Mix in the hot steam room and you have a pretty ripe environment for bacterial growth. To their credit, staff reported that cleaners are employed to sterilize. However I found that the dim lighting largely hide the issues. From the outside of the steam room, you can see mold growing behind the glass where the benches meet it. While the front of the seats were quite slippery. Crossing the hall in the therapy room, you can see the old brick and window of the factory basement and realize how raw and dirty the basement is. Unfortunately, my partner suffers from autoimmune difficulties and afterwards was couch ridden for two days. I'm much more resilient, but also found I felt somewhat ill afterwards.\\n\\nThe spa has great staff and services.

The portion was about .75 cup of thinly sliced sausages. The drinks were also palatable, but, again, not something that I would feel is remarkable (I ordered a Special Matcha Milk Tea with Tapioca and No Sugar).The tapioca in my drink was strange- too mushy on the outside and under-cooked on the inside. In general, the snacks are pretty standard, nothing I would visit the place again for. This is not a place for a meal (though they do have a few entrée items offered at an equally unjust quality and price), but greasy snacks (which have an allure of its own, but not particularly from this place).\\n\\nAmbiance 2.5/5 (weighed at 15% of final score)\\n\\nIt was summer afternoon when I went, so it was warm outside as is. The moment I stepped in it felt like a sauna. The AC, for whatever reason, wasn\\'t on. I only give it a passing score for the past few times when I went and the temperature was acceptable. Perhaps due to the humidity in the store, it also felt dirtier than usual. The Wii that they have there gave the place a very chill feeling. A place to hang out with friends as a group, maybe, but not a date spot. The place is also relatively small, so I would not recommend this for groups more than 8.\\n\\nService 2/5 (weighed at 15% of final score)\\n\\nI joined my friends later, but that doesn\\'t give them an excuse to not hand me a menu. I feel that it is the least they can do to hand me a menu within 5 minutes when I first arrive. When asked to explain what the difference between the \"special matcha milk tea\" ($5.99) and \"matcha milk tea\" ($4.45) is, they couldn\\'t really explain in much detail and simply replied \"The powder is different.\" I asked whether that made the more expensive one better, and they simple muttered a \"Yeah.\" Not impressive product knowledge to say the least. The service provided felt like the don\\'t-bug-me-and-I-won\\'t-bug-you type.\\n\\nCost 2/5 (weighed at 10% of final score)\\n\\nFor the quality of everything within the store, it was on the expensive side. Not that worth it. I would much prefer to spend a few more dollars for a nicer place like GoForTea or Destiny, if not the neighbourhood-friendly Chatime across the same plaza with the slightly lower price range.\\n\\nOther 1/5 (weighed at 10% of final score)\\n\\nI use this category as a brownie point category while summarizing. The overall experience was slightly below average, but the place does have a TV with a Wii (Mario Kart and Super Smash Brawl, anyone?), some board games, and some card games. So props to that.\\n\\nSide note is that they only accept debit card payments when your personal total bill is over $10. They do not accept credit cards. I did not deduct any points for this, although it is slightly inconvenient, because it isn\\'t completely strange for bubble tea places like these to have the Over $10 rule. You cannot bring outside food in, even if it\\'s not offered on their menu, and the number of drinks/items ordered must at least equal to the number of guests at the table.\\n\\nFinal Score: 44.5/100 = 2 Stars\\n\\nUnlikely to go back there by myself, or recommend to others, unless my friends go there for a casual hangout.',\n",

I wrote something to the effect that the highlight of my night had been the time spent under the artificial heaters in the men's washroom.  Which it undeniably was. \\n\\nA friend recently purchased tickets for the Nutrilite Canadian Championship final between the Vancouver Whitecaps FC and Toronto FC in late May and the weather was absolutely atrocious.  I do point some of the blame in the direction of mother nature and her unrelenting ferocity, however the venue did little if anything to combat the situation.\\n\\nAs the hard flying rain off Lake Ontario pelted me in the face from every angle imaginable I couldn't help but notice the lack of field coverage.  we were essentially sitting ducks for mother natures exacting wrath, there was no protection in the form of a roof (standard in most outdoor stadiums), or any other form of makeshift awning.  We were forced to seek refuge in the unheated, and only partially covered concourse, jostling for position closest to the nearest beer cart.  After sidling up to a beer cart, reaching into our pockets and sifting through drenched bills we attempted to get said beer, we were both asked for ID, (not a problem), yet when my friend produced his British Columbia identification they initially refused to accept this.  So you can imagine the mood that we were in.  Cold, bored and sober, not what you typically go for when partaking in a live sporting event, or any sporting event for that matter.\\n\\nEventually the crowd thinned out as it became a near certainty that the game would cease to continue and we were able to get a prime spot next to the urinals under the one and only heater in the men's washroom.  This would become our temporary sanctum for the better part of two hours.  When the game did get called, the first rain out in Toronto FC history we were informed there was no defined refund policy.  It wouldn't be until several days later that my friend learned the steps necessary to refund his ticket, as he would not be able to make the rescheduled game due to geographical constraints.\\n\\nSmall things could make all the difference in the world to the successful operation of BMO Field-things like adequate coverage, paper towels in the washrooms, a heated and fully covered concourse and defined refund policies in the event that mother nature shows her teeth.

As long as Toronto\\'s been waiting for some sort of professional soccer team, it has waited equally long for a soccer-specific stadium to house the matches.  BMO Field answers that need and delivers a truly unique fan experience.\\n\\nConstructed in time for Toronto FC\\'s inaugural season, it is an open-air stadium holding over 20,000.  There are stands on the west, south and east sides with the north being an open standing-room-only-beer-tent type affair.  Care has been given to ensure that there is not an obstructed sight-line or admittedly a bad seat in the house.  Even the arguably worst seat in the house (furthest up and to the extreme far left or right on the main stand, provides a decent view.\\n\\nRefreshments abound.  Yes, you can get the regular staples of pizza, hot dogs, you know, the usual.  Go to the north side stands where you\\'ll be able to find scotch eggs, chip butties (a French fry sandwich that if you\\'ve not tried, you have to), and other typical football-y fare.  Beer is sold pretty much everywhere in the stadium.

This is probably where you do not want to sit.  Get to the south-side stands where not only is the atmosphere chaotic, it is typically a non-stop pulsing mass of people singing, chanting and bouncing.  You\\'ll be lucky if uttering the phrase \"Sit down please, I can\\'t see!\" ends happily with merely a stern look shot your way and then the continuation of business as usual.  Bedlam.\\n\\nThere are a couple of drawbacks with the stadium, one being the pitch itself.  It is artificial turf and though top of the line, it still is artificial.  Though, given Toronto\\'s climate and the costs associated with real turf, this can be forgiven.  On the plus side, during the winters, a dome is placed over the field allowing several six-a-side games to carry on throughout the cold months.

But this is my review.\\n\\nI visited GoodLife on August 14, 2015. A smiling blonde girl at the front kiosk greeted me immediately and I let her know that I was interested in the free 3-day pass as advertised. She had me meet with a membership sales counselor (trainer? I don\\'t know) named Matt. Matt was awesome, and super friendly (again, STARK contrast to the other CA gym I visited). He readily answered any questions I had and gave me a thorough tour of the entire facility, which was gorgeous. He boasted about the sauna/steam room/TRX area/yoga area/insert other unnecessary amenity here, which are good options to have, but I feel are secondary to basic GYM equipment (i.e: weights, cardio machines, resistance machines). The two main pieces of equipment that I felt were really strange not to have were an Iso High Row and a decline barbell bench. There were others, but those two stick out. \\n\\nThe bottom floor has maybe 6 or 7 assorted benches to use, which was definitely not enough for the area. I had to wait a few times for a bench, and even asked one guy if I can work in to have him tell me no (he was doing some weird circuit thing. He used two different benches, did some jumping jacks, then stretched on a wall... I forget all the steps). The rest of the people I encountered were friendly enough, but again, not friendly like the crowd at Venice. I couldn\\'t get over how QUIET this gym was!! I felt like a grunting/sweating/swearing animal. No, I don\\'t grunt or swear on purpose, but if it helps me get through one more rep, then so be it. \\n\\nThe location is great, it was a 10-minute streetcar ride away from the AirBnB I was renting in Trinity Bellwoods, and seemed central to everything.\\n\\nIN SHORT---\\nGreat location for downtown Toronto, EXTREMELY friendly staff, and a beautiful facility. Cardio bunnies and group fitness fans will love this place, but it\\'s not very \"lifter-friendly\", unless you don\\'t mind the weird looks and feeling like the proverbial \"bull in a china shop\".

Well that is kind of how I felt at the Spa at the Hazelton although my version of it would be \"Services 10 . . . .Facility 3\".\\n\\nJust know  if you are looking for the total relaxing spa experience- you may not find it here.  But you will get an outstanding massage or other service.\\n\\nAfter staying in the Hazelton Hotel- I had very high hopes for the spa as upstairs in the hotel- my every wish was accommodated.  So when I took the elevator down to the basement level- I was a little surprised that I was not warmly greeted- rather I was asked what size shoe I wore and then the receptionist walked me into the small but functional locker room, pointed out my locker and left.\\n\\nI chased her down and asked where the waiting area was for my treatments and she said I needed to come back out to the reception area.  Hmmm . . . .seemed odd but okay.\\n\\nNow I go to spas all around the world so I was familiar with the lock on the locker and how it functioned- but even a spa I go to all the time still takes the time to ask if I am familiar with the locking system.  And forget reading the instructions on the inside of the door if you are a glasses wearing gal.  A great spa makes everything effortless and that was just not the case here.\\n\\nI got changed and went back out to the reception area to sit and wait for my services.  Again- this was a bit odd.  There were 4 small seats squished into an alcove right by the check in area.  So there were people coming and going the whole time I was trying to relax to anticipate my services.  And then forget about relaxing there when you are finished . . . .the seats were full so there is no place to relax after your services either.  They really need to invest in some type of space for this.\\n\\nThe other thing I never even found was the pool and wet area.  Turns out it\\'s on another floor- so if you were thinking of a swim after your services- you will need to go upstairs.  Another miss for me although there is a steam room in the spa area.\\n\\nOkay- so enough of the down side- let\\'s move on to the stars of this spa and those are surely the services!\\n\\nI started with their scrub.  Sarah, the technician was as great as the service as when we were finished- my skin felt like a baby\\'s skin!  And then after a quick shower- she massaged some wonderful hydrating lotion into my skin and sent me on to my next service.  \\n\\nIf there was any downside here- it was that the shower to rinse off in was back in the locker room area versus being in the actual service room which most places that offer scrubs do.  I had to put my robe back on- walk past the reception area and into the shower and then back again to finish the service.  And while I was escorted to the shower and given a new robe and slippers- it still isn\\'t as nice as just stepping off the table, into the shower and back onto the table.\\n\\nMy next service was an hour long deep tissue massage.  Elizabeth was my therapist and she was also great!  She took the time to listen to any issues I was having and then spent the next hour working on those areas.  She also spent time after the service suggesting some things that I can do at home to relieve some of the stress in my shoulders.\\n\\nAt this point, I would have liked to sit and relax somewhere with some hot tea but as I mentioned earlier, there really isn\\'t a place here to do that so I just got dressed and left.\\n\\nAll in all?

We called during the drive to give a heads up that we were possibly running late given the heavy slush and snow on the road (we called at 10am... and had left Mississauga at 9:30). We realized there was no way we were going to make it on time. The receptionist advised that they would work with whatever time they had as long as we arrived within our time slot (11am-12pm). It was then 11:30 am and we were stuck on the Gardiner behind an accident and drivers going 40km an hour. We were nowhere close to the spa and didn\\'t know what to do. We called asking what our options were as it didn\\'t look like we would be able to make it on time. We asked if we could either be pushed back later or come on another date. We didn\\'t ask for a refund or anything like that. The manager Victoria had no sympathy for us and said that the policy was if we don\\'t cancel within 24 hours we will be charged the full price. I told her we were not trying to cancel we were just late and had left home 1.5 hours before our appointment. I was only asking for our appointments to be moved! I told her the roads were horrendous and we were trying our best to get there on time but it was completely out of our hands. I asked if there was anything she can do given the situation we were in. She said \"yeah we had a few people trying to cancel today but I told them the same thing\" and repeated \"sorry our cancellation policy is 24 hours or full charge\". Victoria offered us each $50 gift cards to use for the future but that was it. So we lost the $140 each and on top of that she wanted us to come back for another treatment where we would have to pay again and get $50 off.... It\\'s unfortunate that such a highly established spa would not be more understanding or willing to work with us knowing what a horrible situation we were in. On top of that I was never provided with anything advising me of this cancellation policy. Victoria also stated that she couldn\\'t do anything further because \"our technicians expect to be paid 100% of the amount because they are there on time for their appointments\". It just made us all really upset as potential clients. We were looking forward to the spa. It\\'s sad because things can happen anytime, emergencies can happen!! Especially on a day like today with the snow conditions and completely brutal roads. There was absolutely no sympathy, no understanding, no care given at all for our situation. Just the same thing repeated again and again \"sorry you didn\\'t cancel within 24 hours and that\\'s our policy\".  After over 2 hours of driving in horrible weather conditions we arrived at approx 11:54am but were too late!!!! We rejected the $50 credit because honestly with their customer service I will never be coming back to this place again. TIP- only book here if your 100% confident you won\\'t have to deal with any emergencies/hazardous weather conditions day of because if you do Hazelton spa says TOO BAD!!!

       "  'I would\\'ve rated my first visit to Curbside a 5/5 without hesitation. It was last summer: A younger woman helped me sort out an (apparently very labour-intensive!) problem with my wheel, and even stayed a few minutes past closing in an effort to ensure that I left with my problem resolved. She was friendly, polite, knowledgeable--as was the other bike mechanic that was working on it--and she left me feeling confident that I\\'d be a repeat customer.\\n\\nRecently, I was experiencing some issues with my bike again (entirely unrelated to the ones before), so I figured I\\'d go back to Curbside, since they were so great to me before. This time, I had an experience almost entirely opposite from the first time. \\n\\nFirst, bad selection; I\\'d only discovered this on this occasion, since my previous visit didn\\'t involve parts, but only labour. The clerk pointed me in the direction of a $70 bike saddle for which there was no cheaper alternative. (This, of course, isn\\'t the clerk\\'s fault; but perhaps the store should consider getting some more moderately-priced alternatives for things like this.) \\n\\nBut everything\\'s overpriced in bike stores; this much I\\'ve come to expect. The second problem, however, was what left me truly dissatisfied with my experience.\\n\\nThe main problem I was having was my loose bottom bracket. The clerk very quickly replied, without further inspection, that it was broken and that I would need a new one. He then shooed me off to the mechanic in the back.\\n\\nThe mechanic took a quick look, and within 30 seconds, he suggested that I \"scrap my bike for parts\", and that it was \"no good\". I don\\'t deny that there are issues with the bike; this is, after all, why I brought it in. But to tell a customer that his bike is worth little more than scrap parts is a verdict that should be handed down more delicately, and certainly not with a huge grin, since it is almost certainly going to jostle any customer that hears it. To treat the matter so dismissively, and then send the customer on his way (I would have been willing to pay for the repairs, had he shown any interest in providing me with the details!), this seems to me like a bad way of doing things. \\n\\nAt any rate, this verdict of totaling out my bike seemed to provide him and all the other nearby employees with a great deal of pleasure. There wasn\\'t any effort to provide me with alternatives to consider, or ways to make it rideable temporarily; rather, it was a very curt \"nah, just scrap it\", and that was that.\\n\\nUnfortunately for them, I had a handful of nearly $100 worth of bike parts I was ready to buy, and I also had every intention to go check out the bike lights, which of course would have added a bit more to my overall purchase. So my total--including the fact that I could have very easily been convinced to drop $200+ for repairs--could have easily surpassed $350. Instead, the condescension and disinterest on their part caused me to leave without purchasing anything.\\n\\nThe two guys standing at the front of the store were smirking and giggling at my bike as I wheeled it out. I took it across the street to Sweet Pete\\'s, where I was met with a helpful team who gave me a detailed list of the cost for repairs. Ultimately, they quoted me $150, which I am happy to spend to save a bike that I love, and I felt respected, appreciated, and welcome the entire time.\\n\\nMaybe this was an isolated experience; as I said, I had a great experience the first time I went to Curbside. But given that this recent experience went poorly, what motivation do I have to go back, now that I\\'ve seen how it compares to its competitor across the street?',\n",

Ally gave me a good estimate of the total cost of the bicycle with upgrades and a time estimate to when the store would the getting the bikes.\\n\\nAfter a few weeks, I called the store to check if the bikes were in and Ally, who remembered me, told me that they were in. I went to the shop and Aaron showed me the bicycle. He let me take it for a test ride behind the store and expressed concern in the fit of the bicycle for me. I told him it would take a little adjusting, but it would be fine. \\n\\nNow it was time to talk about upgrades. We went back into the store and talked to the mechanics who went through what they would have to do in order to upgrade the bike to have 3 speeds. There was concern in whether or not it could be done, but one of the mechanics, Rama, measured the 3-speed hub on a Dutchi and was certain that he would be able to make it work. \\n\\nAll of the upgrades were going to be costly and including labour, the bike would cost more than an adult Linus 3-speed Dutchi. Without me having to ask, Aaron worked on getting me a deal and it was agreed upon that I would just pay for the bicycle and the price of parts (no labour), making cost of the bicycle with upgrades less than the adult Dutchi. \\n\\nThe mechanics finished the upgrades in less time than estimated and Rama called me as soon as it was done. \\n\\nIn my experience at Curbside Cycle, I never felt pressured to buy anything and everyone seemed genuine in wanting to make this bicycle happen for me, which I greatly appreciated. The staff is very knowledgeable in what they do. I will definitely be back for anything this bike requires, and I will be recommending this store to any cyclist that will listen.\",\n",

We went back in and told the person who I think is the owner (not too sure) about the mix up. He  apologized for the mishap and remade our milki teas again, not only that but he was nice enough to fix our previous drinks.\\n\\nI'm not sure if I'll be back here again, I feel like another mistake could happen lol.

The BOGO only allowed 4 types of drinks, which happened to be their 4 best sellers.\\n\\nI honestly do not remember about the price - I believe it was around $5.70, which is comparable to its competitor across the street (Cha Time).\\n\\nMy significant other (SO) did not like the experience first time we had Gong Cha back at the Markham location. However, since it was a BOGO, we decided to give it a try again. We ordered Milk Foam Wintermelon (#1 seller) and Winter Melon Milk Tea with grass jelly (I believe this was #3 or #4 best seller). \\n\\nWinter Melon Milk Tea w/ grass jelly:\\n\\nThe milk tea is nothing special. In fact, I would said Cha Time has much better flavour/grass jelly for this type of tea. What I found with the tea was that  it didn't feel particularly flavourful. I found their grass jelly to be really strong, almost medicinal flavour to it. Skip this and stick with the milk foam. \\n\\n\\nMilk Foam Wintermelon:\\n\\nHonestly, you should give this a tea try before judging Gong Cha. I believe there i a reason why this is #1 seller here and it really is different from any drinks I had at any bubble tea place. The milk foam is quiet dense. The milk foam's flavour reminds me of cream from butter beer at Universal Studio down at Orlando. Its got dense, creamy, slightly salty/sweet flavour, You are able to either 1) mix with the drink 2) drink out of the cup or 3) drink out of the straw to get different experience. I enjoyed this drink a lot - only thing is, I am not sure what wintermelon is supposed to taste like, so I am not sure if it was the cream I enjoyed or the actual flavour of the drink. \\n\\nThe service, as expected due to BOGO and opening day, was not great. Even when the drink was ready, no one knew if all the drinks were ready for us. We had to look over the counter and indicate to them that the drink that was sitting on their counter for 5 min was ours. I also think they made a mistake on the sweet level for our drink. We ordered 4 drinks (two of each) and some of them tasted a lot sweeter than the other. \\n\\nI would go back here when I feel like I want the Milk Foam drinks again.\",\n",

I predict you\\'ll only need one cup, its memory lingering on your tongue for hours.  Management have the confidence to offer but a single option, the House Blend: a complex, heady brew evoking imagery of the Sulawesian coastline.  I wanted to ask if it was single origin but I think the clerk was a new hire, and it appears the website is still under construction.\\n\\nBesides that, the service was personal yet unobtrusive.  As I made my selection, he made sure to point at every available item, just to make sure I was aware of all the options.  How often do you get this from the more apathetic staff at Timothy\\'s?  This is hospitality only an independent could provide.\\n\\nOf course deciding is hard, but all your favourites are there, plus a few quirky riffs unique to the establishment.  Take the ChocoPeanut for example: blonde pillows of vanilla-scented fritter coated in a rich chocolate ganache, finally finished with a generous studding with crushed roasted peanuts.

The result is a coffee-flavoured donut and donut-flavoured coffee.  It\\'s actually brilliant.  Get it here first before Colborne Lane copies the idea.\\n\\nWhile enjoying, I noticed many of the pastries came displayed with playful signs (\"Dates Square\"), a fun break from the drab, predictable spellings of more corporate establishments.  And while I found something I wanted, the evening selection was a bit slim, with the most popular items long since ravaged by local clientele.

Sometimes you don't want to pay high end prices and other times you want  a pick me up and you can do this at Nordstroms. \\nI like the first floor and the clean feeling of openness in the atmosphere.  In terms of design, I think saks has more of a pulling appeal and more of a luxurious feel.  Nordstroms has more of a casual but elegant environment.  It is way less intimidating to walk into and that fact alone will make it do well for consumers not always wanting to pay hefty prices.  Thats also what will separate it from Holts and Saks. That it caters to various price points.\\nI will make a shoutout mention to the manager of Mac makeup.  Who would have thought that I would get pulled in there when I could have bought mac in a million places.  But the manager there has mastered customer service, attentive, listened, genuinely nice, and at the end of the day Nordstroms and MAC is lucky to have her because she makes customers feel valued and embodies the nordstrom customer service first motto.\\n\\nThe second floor was a okay.

So my review probably reflects more on the service I received. \\nI came for a free bike fitting, since I had purchased my bike at the bike show from D\\'Ornella\\'s and it was included in the cost. \\nI assumed I would not be purchasing anything in this process - perhaps naive of me. \\nWhile my measurements were being assessed and changes were being made, Neil, the guy fitting my bike, began replacing items without actually asking me if it was okay. I hadn\\'t intended on spending much money, and suddenly a $140 bike seat was being attached to my bike, and a piece to raise the handlebars. I understand that these were maybe preferred for my riding comfort, but had I been asked, I likely would have consented anyways. It was the presumption that really bothered me. It also bugged me that I was constantly \"reminded\" through the fitting that I was lucky to be getting it for free because he had a kinesiology background and most people paid a lot of money for this. Well, obviously anyone who purchased a bike at the bike show was getting it for free. So if he felt it was worth so much more than why offer it as part of the package?\\n\\nAnyways, the good parts - the adjustments made to the bike were very helpful and it is now a more comfortable ride for me (though ironically I liked my old \"too small\" seat more), he took me on a short ride around the neighborhood to ensure everything was good, and I bought another part (my choice) that he installed for me. I was appreciative of the service but really feel that there could be a lot of improvements made in the customer service end of things. It\\'s not likely that I would return.',\n",

Each time there is an outgoing message saying to leave a message but it\\'s not possible because their voicemail is always full. Finally after 2 weeks I opened a dispute with PayPal.

I opened a dispute with PayPal to get my money refunded. It\\'s 2 days later, with zero satisfaction, so I have escalated the dispute. BUYER BEWARE. Tula should have a notice about their closure on their website and message centre. They have no right to take online payments and pretend they are operating. What they are doing is misleading and fraudulent. I am perplexed by the difficulty Tula is putting me through. All they need to do is refund my money so that I may spend it elsewhere while they get on with their \"hiatus\" \"renovation\" \"relocation\".\\n\\nUPDATE: It is 8 days now of waiting for Tula to respond to PayPal.

I've never had anything like it - the melding of the flavours and the chef's deft hand with the spicing is unbelievable.\\n\\nWe always get the merguese lamb platter - plump, merguese sausages served with a pile of sauteed vegetables and delicious fried potatoes in another addictive sauce - you'll literally want to lick your plate clean and you'll be chasing every last drop of sauce with the warm, fluffy pita bread provided.\\n\\nI also love the trout with coriander - a generous portion of trout in a delicate, coriander-flavoured sauce also served with vegetables or couscous.\\n\\nI find the mint tea overly sweet, but that's probably just a difference in taste.  \\n\\nThe service is functional and warm and we're always made to feel welcome.\",\n",

And if it wasn't from the reviews, I probably would never have gone in. But just as he was on the phone, the man (I'm assuming owner) greeted me with much enthusiasm and a huge smile.  The food was reasonably priced, an appetizer and one dish for  $18, and the portions are quite large. \\n\\nThe 'Salad Grill Mushwa' has an interesting flavor which my mother hated, but I enjoyed for the most part. It's not something you would come across everyday, and they serve it will hard boiled eggs (*gag*) whose odor definitely does not persuade your nose to go anywhere near the dish. However, once the initial dipping of the pita into the 'salad', you kind of can't stop.\\n\\nWe also ordered the 'Vegetable Couscous', which was, as promised, a large portion that was relatively filling. The flavor isn't something I've tried before, but I did enjoy it.

The guy said it was not like any other calamari dish and he was right. It came in this spicy sauce which was great.\\n\\nI ordered the trout in coriander sauce. It came with potatoes and eggplants. Everything was grilled (over hot coals i think) so it had a great grilled flavour. I love when they grill meat first and then put the sauce on it. Thoroughly excellent and very reasonable for a fish entree at $15. \\n\\nMy friend had the merguese which I think has been written about at length here. Its lamb sausage. I tried it.

Shio Ramen\\n2. Gyoza\\n3. Mini Slow cooked / braised pork don\\n\\nMy #1 policy in all ramen places that i visit for the first time is to order the simplest bowl of Ramen, which in most cases would be Shio ramen.  I believe this is the perfect way to really evaluate the quality/taste of the original broth.  When you receive your bowl, don't attack the noodles right away but just grab a spoon and take in a spoonful of soup with your eyes closed.   This will explain much of the bowl of that ramen before you even dabble with the noodle.  If the broth is good, it can cover alot of other short coming such as lacking quality of noodles, and other toppings.  \\n\\nFirst of all, Gyoza was frozen, pre-packaged ones.  I make gyoza from scratch from time to time so it was disappointing for me.  And the place isn't all that clean.  There is a corridor that leads to the back of the resto where the bathrooms are situated.  When you go to the bathroom, the kitchen is on the right hand side and you can see part of the kitchen and it is kinda filthy.  Also, the cook with super dirty aprin came out couple of times to serve food until additional evening server arrived and it wasn't pleasant especially after seeing the state of the kitchen was in on my way and back to/from the bathroom.\\n\\nThen the mini-don came out. That was the best dish and it was slightly better than average.  Then finally the shio ramen came out. *game over music*.  Very disappointed with sub-par flavoured broth and soft/un-chewy noodles just did it for me and i will NOT return to Hakata.  IMO, Santouka / Ryus are top notch but still yet to have tried Isshin and Ryoji.  Kinton's way over-rated yet Sansotei was pretty decent.

The interior is amazing and provides a truly authentic experience.  So much wood everywhere, even the air conditioner evokes a sense of Japanese atmosphere.  \\n\\nThis place takes credit cards.  Has a lunch special for $13 every Monday to Friday from noon to 3 pm.  The lunch special consists of their regular Ramen and a choice of either Karage (fried chicken) rice or Chashu (thinly sliced pork belly) rice.\\n\\nThe size of both is good for its price.  \\n\\nThe ramen's broth is surprisingly not too salty, but it's thick and you can definitely taste the fat which gives the broth its flavour.  I didn't regret the choice of wavy noodles either.  Although the Chashu provided were only two pieces, not a satisfying prospect. \\n\\nThe Chashu itself was burnt which significantly hurts the flavour as the carbonized taste overpowers the richness of the pork belly's flavour.\\n\\nThe Karage also was burnt, and similarly impacted negatively the taste.  More care must be put into these things as it does really mask the taste that dish is intended to have!\\n\\nThere wasn't much interaction with the waitress.  Aside from the food being brought to you, you do everything on your own.  There's even a pitcher of water for you to pour for yourself. \\n\\nTwo red flags in my experience here.\\n\\nFirst.  A customer knocked down the jar containing spoons and chopsticks onto the floor.  The waitress goes and puts the contents right back into the jar instead of taking it back to get it washed.  That's not a great feeling, knowing that customers later will be using spoons and chopstick that has been on the floor, where customers walked around god knows what.\\n\\nSecond.  Not even a greetings on the way in and a goodbye on the way out.  That's not really great customer service, especially when a restaurant is trying to replicate the Japanese experience.

The black tonkatsu ramen was my favorite for the longest time until the chef told me that it's actually burnt garlic... My friends always tried to convince me that the black tonkatsu tasted like burnt... I was like no way, it has to be black sesame. So yea... ever since what the chef told me, I never went back.. not because their ramen doesn't taste good, don't get me wrong, the broth is amazing and it's less MSG-ee than most of the other ramen places in TO... but the burnt stuff was quite a turnoff.\\n\\nI would recommend this place if you are a huge ramen fan, the broth is not bad and their side dishes are pretty good too.

       "  \"My second time coming here since their grand opening so I believe its time to finally give me first review !\\n\\nFor dinner, I tried the black tonkatsu (around $12) and the tan tan men red spicy (around $14) and a side of katsudon with rice (around $5). Both with wavey ramen instead of straight \\n\\nBlack Tonkatsu - This both came quite warm and I was expecting the wavey ramen to be abit thicker but it came in a thinner consistency than I am used to. The broth was definitely rich and there was not an overwhelming amount of bean sprouts which I am not a fan of seeing at the regular ramen joints nowaday. However, as I began eating this bowl.. I felt that the broth seemed to get a little too strong for my liking. Could not drink the soup after finishing the ramen unfortunately. The quality of the Cha siu was good but the 2 slices was not enough as it seemed that one of the slices seemed quite small so I guess I only got 1.5 slices of meat in this bowl. \\n\\nTan Tan Men  - I was hoping that this bowl of ramen would be more spicy or at least had a bit of a kick in the broth but it was not spicy whatsoever (I am actually sensitive to spiciness). I've tried desperately adding the red chili pepper powders served on the side ....but it didnt help relief my spicy cravings. The flavour of the ground beef had a hint of sweet marinade and well garnished garlic flavour which I enjoyed. Unfortunately I was hoping for abit more in this bowl of ramen as the price of this was quite steep. Again the thickness and heaviness of the broth was too overwhelming to allow drinking afterwards. \\nI felt quite thirsty after this meal. \\n\\nKatsudon - There was a total of 4 bit sized slightly larger than popcorn chicken katsus ontop of a bed of rice garnished with scallions and kupie mayo (amazing). The ratio between protein and rice was roughly 1/5 so I ended up eating rice with the remaining overpowering leftover soup which was not something I was expecting but it was alright.....certainly not worth the price of $5.5. The katsu was nicely cooked where the outside was crispy and the inside was still moist which I appreciated. \\n\\nConclusion- Hakata has all the ingredients to become a strong contender in a competitive ramen neighbourhood in North York but I felt that they did not offer enough for the price that they charge ($40 after tax and tips). It is a shame to see less and less ramen joints offering the egg without extra charge. Nonetheless, the store was clean and the service was good. \\n\\nI hope they are prepared for more competition as more and more ramen joints are appearing every month. I am looking forward to seeing Sansotei Ramen come in this neighbourhood as they offer competitive fair price and portions for their meals. \\n\\nPlease note that they do not accept Amex :(\",\n",

O.M.G, the chicken was out of this world!!! One bite into this thing and a burst of wine flavour is released onto your tastebuds. This chicken was absolutely amazing. Sounds like an exaggeration but trust me, it's THAT damn good. The rice and its condiments was a perfect combo! Mayo, teriyaki sauce (I believe) green onions and seseme seed... you can taste each of these ingredient's aroma unravel the more you eat it.

       "  'This is the best ramen places I have been to up north in uptown. I would rate it higher than Kinton, since its noodles are more cooked and the meat is more tender than Kinton\\'s. What we got this time are Black Tonkotsu and Red Hot Tonkotsu. The ramen menu is small but they have a lot more appetizers. \\n\\nHow I judge with my ramen are usually as follows:\\n1. Egg: 5/5\\n- The egg is nicely cooked, and the egg white has just enough chewiness but still remained extremely tender. The yolk is nice and runny, the edge of it is not solidified unlike a couple of restaurants I have been to before. \\n\\n2. Noodle: 4.5/5\\n- Now, the noodle they serve with the ramen is straight noodles. What this means is, it\\'s intended to slide down your throat faster rather than the wrinkled noodles. The purpose of wrinkled noodles is to soak up more soup and is more flavourful (for example, like the ones they serve at Santouka).\\n- The noodles are more cooked than the ones they serve in Kinton, and slides nicely along with the soup down the throat. It is not as flavourful nor soft as the ones served in Santouka, but it gives enough chewiness that the wrinkled noodle does not have. \\n- I personally am more of a wrinkled noodle fan, but I find the noodle here very nicely cooked and more \"as one\" than the ones I have had downtown. For straight noodles, it\\'s gooooood. \\n\\n3. Meat: 10/5\\n- Yepp, you saw it right, 10/5. It is just simply amazing. The meat melts on the pallet due to the fatty richness it has, and it is really tender and the meat itself is not overly thin. \\n\\n4. Soup: 4/5\\n- The soup base is a little salty and greasy in my opinion. The soup is nice and rich, but salty to the taste. It is drinkable, but make sure you are drinking water at the same time. \\n\\nAppetizer: \"Age Dashi Tofu\": 3.5/5\\n- Think of this...as Takoyai but with Deep fried tofu. The sauce is amazing, and the dried bonito flakes are delicious. The tofu itself is a little bland, so you might want to dip it in the sauce when you eat it.\\n\\nService: 4/5\\n- Service was a little slow. But I don\\'t blame the poor waiter/manager/cook. Yep, it\\'s a 3-in-1 package we got. We went there before the dinner rush so the restaurant is quite dead (only one other table besides us), but we were not greeted when we entered until the guy looked up from his phone. The dinner service was rather fast so no complaints. \\n\\nOverall impression:\\nFood: 5/5\\nService: 4/5\\n\\nWill definitely go there again if I am in the area.',\n",

So I told myself I had to visit David\\'s Tea tonight no matter what to get myself Movie Night and possibly other teas, if I could taste them. I was a bit hesitant because I was afraid of the pushy sales people and how the associates at David\\'s Tea may just shove tea up my nose like so many have told. Instead, I wasn\\'t treated in the same way as everyone else. I walked straight in, taking a look at their specialty teas and got really excited. I walked closer to the counter and stared at the products behind there. I was looked down upon by an Asian girl working behind the counter, \"is there anything I can help you with?\" she asks rudely staring at me as though I was about to steal something. I didn\\'t like that very much but figured she had a bad night so I moved onto the next associate, hoping for better service. \\n\\nThe next woman at David\\'s Tea treated me no better. I noticed there was a tea sample on the counter and took it to smell. I asked her if she knew what it was because it was just as delicious as Movie Night to me! I was so happy, maybe I found something else to purchase already! When I asked the Associate she asked another girl if she knew what the tea was. I had my answer very quickly but couldn\\'t hear the name and was dissapointed to hear it was online only. She also looked at me like I was going to steal something. I hated every second in that store at the moment. The woman she had asked whether or not knew what type of tea the one I previously smelt was at least a bit more understanding. She seemed a bit nicer than the rest. So I decided she was the person who I will get my tea with. \\n\\nMy order in the end was Movie Night and MidSummer\\'s Night Dream. My cousin got the limited edition tins so I asked for those and was dissapointed to hear they only have brown, yellow and blue left. So I got the blue and yellow tins. I was kindly asked if I had a preference for what tea to go in which tin and I told her I had none. She was nice enough to put MidSummer\\'s Night Dream in the yellow tin for me. I was very happy she matched the colours. In the end, as I paid she wasn\\'t as nice as I thought and I never left a store without glaring or sucking my teeth before. \\n\\nI\\'m really not happy with the service at David\\'s Tea. My cost for both items was also 29.53. She filled it up in the tin for me, which said it was 114 grams only. I think I won\\'t be coming back to this store anymore.

I agree with Amanda C  that this place is better then ajisen ramen (one of the worst places to Goto) and put it at par with Kenzo ramen. But totally disagree with her opinion about Niwatei. Niwatei is the best IMO and does not charge you extra for egg and ginger where Hakata does.\",\n",

       "  \"+.5 for service\\n\\nHakata Ramen is probably one of your best choices for ramen in North York, although I do know many who still go to Kinton just down the street. I've been to both places this past week, and I do think Kinton has a busier crowd compared to Hakata. Either way, they're both ramen places serving somewhat different styles of ramen.\\n\\nHakata has a nice Japanese feel with its exterior and interior, as shown by its bamboo decorations. The restaurant isn't that big, but that's normal with many of the ramen joints in the city. We were seated immediately and had menus on the table already when arrived.\\n\\nI've visited Hakata once before, but held off on writing a review as I felt my lukewarm broth that time was a one-off experience. This time I decided to order a Hakata Tonkotsu with a beef tataki on the side. I noticed they added a thin ramen and wavy ramen option recently, and since I like my ramen chewy I decided to go with wavy ramen.\\n\\nThis place was a little slow in preparing your order, but eventually the beef tataki came first, followed by my bowl of ramen. The beef tataki was sliced very thin, so I definitely give the chef credit for perfecting that technique. The beef itself was very good as well as the ponzu sauce, and in some cases I wrapped the beef with the green onions inside.\\n\\nAs for the ramen, the attraction for this place was the chashu, and believe it or not the green onions. This place does not skimp out on its green onions, and the chashu, although thin cut, was still juicy and delicious. The broth, however, was not rich enough for my liking, and the wavy ramen was decent but not overwhelming (I like my ramen thicker and rounder...see Sansotei's thick ramen for the style I like). For $9.80, it is in the lower end of ramen prices, so I think 3 stars is a fair rating overall.\\n\\nService was overall very good, and it was easy to wave down a server when I needed service. For North York standards, Hakata does its job and I would return if I'm nearby, but there are better places out there in the city.\",\n",

Having visited almost every single local Japanese noodles place, I cannot but marvel at Sho Ryu Ken's ability to renew the memory of my taste bud, which has been duly attuned since I was student in Oita, Japan, not far away from Hakata, Japan. I went to this place for the first time with three friends who all at one point of their lives, lived in Japan. After having tried our respective order, we were in full agreement that this ought to be ranked at least as a top 3 Japanese noodle place in the GTA. The particular one of my choice was the Chashu (bbq pork) noodle, the portion of which was considerably larger in comparison to other Ramen places (a plus of course). The soup base is Tonkotsu, which means pork bone and thus speaks for strong salty flavor and thickness. I topped it up with a seasoned egg (aji tama) and red ginger (which is not often offered at any other ramen place in own, but is a popular side order in Japan). Yet the most amazing thing about this ramen is its many slices of pork belly sitting on top. Richly seared, well-flavored and thinly cut, it was tender and succulent, definitely an unforgettable treat to my tongue, something which I thought I can only get to taste when in Japan, not any restaurant here in Toronto. After finishing everything, I couldn't help but order some more soup with a new bowl of noodle (kaetama). Although I'm not a big fan of high carbohydrate intake, yet for the sake of this Sho Ryu Ken's Chashu Ramen, I thought it was well worth it. If you are like me, who is into Japanese Ramen restaurant and is only enthusiastic to the most authentic type of Japanese noodle, why bother yourself with the perennially long waiting-line outside Kinton, which is just a few steps away, just come to Sho Ryu Ken for a real treat!\",\n",

Maybe I need to try the other types? However, compared with other restaurants with a similar soup base, this would be my least favourite. We also ordered the fried chicken but it wasn't worth it because they provide very few and small pieces. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is casual. Has a few window seats but the stools there are very high in comparison to the table. The service was typical, nothing out of the ordinary but not too slow either. I noticed that sometimes when the waitress is busy, the chef will bring out the bowls of noodles himself. That's good because then the noodles won't get cold and soak up all the broth.\\n\\nAll in all, I wasn't too impressed; however, maybe I just went on a bad day.

       "  \"I visited Hakata Ramen with a friend on a Sunday night. We arrived at around 6:30 p.m., and half of the tables were already occupied. This place is great for small groups of four people or less. In fact, they have a lot of tables for groups of four. When we arrived, all the tables for two were already taken, so we sat at the bar table. I thought the bar table would be pretty inconvenient, but there is a ledge in front of you where you could put your jacket and other belongings.\\n\\nMy friend and I didn't feel too adventurous, so we just decided to try the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen (which was the cheapest ramen). I had the straight noodles option (thin noodles), and I thought that they were delicious. However, I actually prefer noodles with a chewier texture, so the wavy option (thicker noodles) would've probably been better. The reason I chose the straight noodles is because I prefer eating thinner noodles. However, I felt that the texture of the straight noodles was not really on par with the thin noodles that other restaurants in downtown Toronto offer. I was a bit disappointed that an egg was considered an extra $1.50. Even though the Hakata Tonkotsu ramen is cheaper than ramen from other restaurants, I would have preferred it if the egg was included. \\n\\nOverall, I liked the ramen regardless because the broth was very light. This is very uncommon for ramen restaurants since the broth is usually heavy, even given a light option (such as Kinton Ramen). Also, I felt like the meat melts in your mouth; the texture was amazing. If you're a big eater, you should order extra noodles though. I was not completely full after my meal.\\n\\nThe service was very good especially since the server came around often with a water jug. I almost never ran out of water before the server came back. In addition, the food came pretty quickly (around 10-15 minutes).\\n\\nI would certainly come back to Hakata if I'm around this area of North York. However, I still prefer the ramen from the downtown Toronto locations more.\",\n",

However, the chashu (bbq pork) slices were too thin. The seating was also a bit cramped. There was no where to put your coats or bags. The floors were also extremely slippery.

Hakata is probably my best bet for ramen in North York.\\n\\nPros:\\nVery good ramen\\nGood service\\n\\nCons:\\nParking can be tough to find\\n\\nI came to Hakata during it's soft opening weekend.  My thoughts at the time was that the ramen was just so so and the portions were rather small because of the bowls they were using.  They have since rectified both and I'm very happy for it.\\n\\nLet's get right into the ramen shall we.  Hakata only does tonkotsu ramen.  They have a couple of varieties of it but they won't have your usual miso, shio, shoyu types you may see at other places.  That being said, they do a very good job at it.  The broth was very rich and not to salty at the end.  You have your choice between traditional thin noodles are thicker wavy noodles.  If you ask me, go with the thicker noodles.  You get two slices of chasiu pork with every order unless you get the chasiu lovers ramen which come with 7!!  The chasiu is thinly sliced so if you like your chasiu, you might want to order more of it.  We also ordered a karaage side dish which was very wonderfully done.  It was crispy on the outside and very tender on the inside.  \\n\\nThe service here was very good.  There was only one waitress when we came in on a saturday afternoon which was quite strange if you ask me.  However, the kitchen staff also were helping out and service was quite quick.  The staff were all pretty nice and friendly.  Going to ramen places with out little one can be quite tough but it was a very good experience and I will have no qualms about coming back with her in the future.\\n\\nBeing on Yonge Street, the parking can be quite tricky.  If all the spots are taken on Yonge Street, it can be quite difficult to find parking.  I have been told before there's parking in the back but there are only a couple of spots at most and some of them say reserved for the H mart next door.  We drove around a couple times before a spot opened on the street.\\n\\nAll in all, Hakata is my go to place for Ramen in North York.

I think that's why it's so oily on top of the fatty chasu juices, but I don't mind it. I love me some grease!  \\n\\nI got the chasu lovers. It was loooaded with mean for $13 bucks.

Regular, black garlic oil, spicy, and regular with crazy amount of meat. In this order they increase in price. The egg was either $1.50 or $2 bucks but I definitely got two. They need a special machine/temperature or something to cook it according to my friend Eve W. so I wanted to take full advantage. I also got it spicy, which means it came with a spoon full of red pepper paste. On second thought, I should have probably brought my own from home to sneak it into the bowl...cuz it's a dollar extra.\\nThe egg was amazing. The center is sooooooo gooey and soft and just ugh. I want to eat those eggs errydayyy fo lyfe. \\n\\nI also had the karaage (fried chicken). It was really soft and yummy, but small portion.

I don't really like this because I don't want to have to add noodles while I'm eating the ramen to begin with. I would've appreciated if they added more noodles in my order before serving it to me. \\n2 Black Tonkotsu ($10.80 each according to their website)  - My friends claimed that the broth was light but the black garlic oil really complemented the ramen. \\n\\nOverall, I had a good experience at Hakata, I would come again if I am ever in the area.

We were a bit disappointed with our experience with kinton ramen (Markham location) and were pleasantly surprised by this place.\\n\\nThe ramen came out quick and hot, very decent sized portions and quite tasty. The noodles had a nice chew and bounce (am dante) and went well with the toppings. The cha shu was large and nicely seasoned with a light torched flavor, though a tad fattier then I would like. I ordered a soy egg on the side which was quite salty. It tasted like it was seasoned with heavy soy sauce, though presentation  wise it was well done. We also had the karage on the side which was excellent for the price point. Large juicy pieces, nice and crispy tough the side sauces were very \"meh\". It was like a side of korean hot pepper paste and some miracle whip, neither of which did much to enhance the flavor. It would have been nice if it was a wasabi mayo or mustard mayo.\\n\\nThe booth seating was actually excellent as well. Lots of space with everything we needed in front of us (jug of water, cutlery, napkins) and there was lots of space.\\n\\nOverall a very pleasant experience, I would give it more a solid 3.5 then a 4, but still good none the less',\n",

       "  \"I first tried Hakata ramen when it first opened and was blown away by it. I'm not normally a ramen person, but Hakata has made me a believer. I've been to Sansotei and Kinton, and in my opinion Hakata is at least as good (Sansotei) if not better (Kinton). Other people I have brought to Hakata think the same.\\n\\nSo I was shocked to see that Hakata currently has an average rating of 2.5 stars. I've gone through the complaints and most seem to revolve around a couple things. \\n\\n- the portion size. The pictures are deceiving. The bowl looks small but I assure you I always leave feeling full, and I pack in more than the average person. I just ate at Kinton and I feel like the portion sizes are the same (I am comparing the two because they are neighbours in North York). \\n\\n- wait time - I've been 3-4 times now and have tried all the options except meat lovers. On average the wait time is about 10 minutes. The longest was 20 minutes. Not a huge deal. They were very busy that night. \\n\\n- broth / pork flavour. Reviews are mixed. All I can say is try it for yourself and you'll love it. \\n\\nNow for my review. In my opinion the black and red (spicy) tonkotsu broth are worth forking over the extra dollar for. The black is a delicious addition of sesame and garlic oil. The red comes with a spoonful of flavourful red paste on the side that you can add to your heart's content. \\n\\nThe price is the same as any premium ramen place. $10.99 for basic, add $1 or so for extras. Again, Kinton has exactly the same prices, so those complaining are not people who have sampled anything above Aji-sen. \\n\\nThe decor is great, as others have already mentioned, with Street Fighter art and a small collection of manga to read at the window. \\n\\nMy hope is that everyone gives Hakata a fair chance. Don't be scared off by the negative reviews, this place is great.\",\n",

The Yonge/Finch area are full of eateries and Hakata is one of the latest ramen joints in the area.\\n\\nThe menu is simple, basic and features all of the popular ramen choices that were similar to the other ramen joints nearby.  For the evening, I had the red hot tonkatsu ramen.  The broth was thick and somewhat creamy, but despite the description of it being a spicy ramen, the miso hot sauce actually came in a spoonful with the ramen so you can decide how hot you want your ramen to be.  Such a simple thing, yet so ingenius!  Nursing a canker sore in my mouth, I could only tolerate a bit of spicyness at this time and it was a welcome feature to be able to control the level of spicyness.   \\n\\nThe soup was flavorful, and aromatic.  It was not overly salty in the beginning until you got to the bottom of the broth, just like other ramen joints.  The noodles were thin however, and unlike at some other ramen joints, you do not have a choice of what kind of noodles you can order.  My ramen came with 2 very thinly sliced pieces of pork belly, very thin that I thought they were like paper thin!  I was hoping for more without having to pay extra.  I've had ramen with thicker pieces of pork belly before at other ramen restaurants! \\n\\nWe had also ordered a side of pan fried gyoza, which were very under cooked.  They tasted more like steamed than fried as they were very soft and mushy to bite into.  This could have been better, but at $3.50 for 5 pieces it is quite the value, if they could only fry it a little longer.\\n\\nDespite it's flaws, I would come back at least to try the other items on the menu.  They have weekday specials such as $4.50 Sapporo on tap on Tuesdays to Thursdays with your order of ramen!\\n\\nService was quick and attentive, given the very small size of the restaurant, making it hard for the friendly staff to miss you wanting to get their attention.

The main reason why I like this place is because it's the main true ramen restaurant in the north end of the city. Everything else is located downtown. In the north this place is competing against Kenzo Ramen, Kinton Ramen and Ajisen Ramen.\\n\\nThis place is not easy to find with the bare eye. It's right on Yonge and McKee, next to the korean H-Mart and across from Owl of Minerva. It's a small mom and pop restaurant covered in all wood. \\n\\nI happen to go when it was not busy and in a middle of a snow storm. It seats around 30 people with a wide open view of the kitchen. The menu selection is limited but enough to accompany the common customer. There are 4 ramen  choices: Hakata Tonkatsu (simple miso ramen), Black Tonkatsu (miso with black garlic flavour), Red Hot Tonkatsu (a tad spicier with korean spicy paste), Chashu Tonkatsu (same as Hakata Tonkatsu but with extra pork belly). The appetizer selection are also scarce with the simple edamame, chicken wings, fried chicken and soy based tofu. \\n\\nThe ramen was thinner and (in my opinion) fit better with the soup base they are serving. The other locations have the typical thick ramen which just becomes too heavy for the meal. The soup base was fair and not too salty, which is why I think Kinton was not listed on top of this place. They give you 4 pieces of pork belly for all the ramen bowls except for Chashu Tonkatsu where they give you another 4 pieces. The soft boiled egg is good but not included with the meal and the yoke is soft. I hate it when I go to places and the egg is hard and overcooked and even worst if the yoke is cooked. That pisses me off the most.\\n\\nThere was a special where if you order an appetizer you can receive a Sapporo draft for $3.80. \\n\\nOverall this place is quick, clean and simple.

It was my first visit and it\\'s going to be my last. I knew what I was getting myself into - so, I didn\\'t have a huge expectation for a fancy place; the reviews did prepare me for that. \\n\\nOnce I got to the front of her house, her front door was open. I didn\\'t know whether or not to just enter or just find a doorbell...but wait, she doesn\\'t have a doorbell. I just awkwardly stood in front of her house for 5-10 minutes, until she came upstairs from the basement to get something and told me to come in. Walked through her hallway, saw all her friendly animals, and walked down to her basement. She was already working on a client, so I was asked to take a seat on her couch - but, the couch had her personal things lying on it (clothes, hangers, jackets,etc.). I didn\\'t exactly know where I should sit without sitting on something. I guess, she realized that there were no seatable area on the couch, so she came over and moved some things around. I waited for approximately 20 minutes as she was finishing up with dying the other client\\'s hair. \\n\\nOnce I got onto the seat, I told her how I needed more layers and pretty much to thin out my thick hair. All she said was \"okay\" and directed me over to the next room where the hair sink is. No conversation. Quick wash and then back over to the seat. She just used a razor type of tool and trimmed the top layer of my hair. The bottom half of my hair was UNTOUCHED - not even a trim! When I brought it up to her, she just said that I asked for layers, so she\\'s giving me layers. Before she finished, she did use some hemp products on me as hair treatment.\\n\\nOverall, this haircut is not worth the expensive price she charges, even with a 20% off student discount.

I have searched far and wide for trustworthy Veterinary care for the plethora of beautiful animals I have been privileged to have in my life so I have had my fair share of experiences with vets and few have lived up to the challenge.\\n\\nI decided to try Greenwood as they advertise the vet being Dr Murr I believe who specializes in the care of rabbits and small animals. However  I was seen by one of the other vets ( Dr Mackenich; who's name is conveniently not available on the website, so the spelling may be wrong ) when I took my bunny Wonka in to be examined, which did concern me slightly as I was hoping to see the specialist who was the primary reason I chose to drive to the other end of the city.\\n\\nShe seemed pleasant enough however her only real concern was for me to bring in all 4 of my rabbits, 3 of which aren't showing any symptoms but she insisted... Of course... That all 4 come in so they could charge us the exam fee x4.  I told her I was unable to bring in all the rabbits at once and asked if there was anything they could recommend to make it possible but they offered zero options or help in anyway. They seemed more concerned with pushing products then really helping the animal. We were told at the end of that visit that we would only have to drop by and pickup the next bout of wonkas meds but when the time came around they not only insisted that we pay them yet another examination fee for Wonka but they wanted to see all the rest of the bunnies and charge us the exam fee for each. As I said ive dealt with many vets and I know my last two didn't require an exam fee for a follow up so after driving all the way across the city to a tiny, kinda run down vet with no parking I was a little taken aback by how greedy they were.\\n\\nThe lady at the front desk was also a little off putting, she cracked a few sarcastic jokes which although I can't remember the context exactly I found unsettling at the time. She had a pretty cold and sarcastic demeanor that I didn't find conducive to what you would expect from a secretary or someone dealing with the public and again offered no help or information when asked. \\n\\nLastly, I had to literally hound them just to get a response... I had called to inquire about the next round of meds to have the secretary claim someone would get back to me which they never did. They knew cause they administered the meds that he required the meds for a certain date otherwise any progress made would have been lost. So having to chase them down to do their jobs and then have them try to swindle us for more money was needless to say very upsetting for me.\\n\\nI will not be making the hr long trip again to venture out to be exploited by another greedy vet as there are plenty to choose from and I'm sure I can find one closer to rip me off\",\n",

I would not hesitate recommending bringing your rabbit to her. \\nUnfortunately, for what ended up being the last week of my rabbit\\'s life, Dr. Banerjee was on vacation, and we were given her replacement, Dr. Merryn McIninch.\\nWe were there that day to check the dose of the medication we were giving my rabbit to treat congestive heart failure (he was acting normal, but had been breathing hard for a while). Dr. McIninch tried to convince us to put him down then and there. Except he was still happy and eating and running and jumping, so I said no. She increased the medication dose with the warning it might just make things worse. But her attitude was very much, \"this is already over so nothing really matters.\" She did come off as somewhat knowledgeable about rabbits, but had zero bedside manner and was very cold and stand offish. In fact, for the follow up appointment, I specifically booked for once Dr. Banerjee was back because I did not want to deal with Dr. McIninch again. Unfortunately, my rabbit never made it to the follow up appointment.\\nLiterally the evening after seeing Dr. McIninch, my animal started to decline. The meds made him dizzy and he was falling over. And I\\'d talked to other rabbit owners about other possible solutions. I tried calling about changing his meds twice and the tech (who was wonderful--I will say all of the techs I dealt with in this place are INCREDIBLE. Thank God for them) asked the Dr and was told they would get back to me the next week and not to worry. My rabbit never made that, either. \\nOne morning, he fell over and couldn\\'t get up. We brought him in, knowing full well what we were going to have to do. And unfortunately for us again, Dr. McIninch was the one to do it. After giving me a low blow remark about how she told me she saw this coming days ago (which is what any grieving owner wants to hear), she went about the procedure with not a trace of emotion. It was NOT quick, and it was NOT peaceful, though I have been told by others rabbits fight going to sleep, so this may be common. I don\\'t know. All I know is it was the worst 30-40 minutes of my life and I was offered zero comfort by the vet. When it was over, all the Dr said was, \"His heart has stopped.\" and she left the room. I was practically collapsing on the floor with grief and didn\\'t even warrant a kind word from this woman. Once again, thank goodness for the kind techs who got me Kleenex and hugged me.\\n\\nI don\\'t like leaving this review. I used to tell everyone with a rabbit to go to this place. And I still will. If you get Dr. Banerjee. (The problem is, if you were unlucky like me, you might not get her every time). Or if you are okay with someone who is cold and unsympathetic, then that is okay. I was not, and I truly feel my pet (my best friend) deserved better in those final hours, and I can\\'t help but wonder if his dose was increased too much too fast because Dr. McIninch had already given up on him.

The salon is in her house, as I knew, but it's in the basement, and a bit dingy, particularly the location where they wash your hair, which is in an unfinished section.  I didn't feel like Miranda was particularly good at listening to what I wanted.  I stressed that I wanted dark blond hair and that my last color had ended up too light...but her color was even lighter than the previous one.  Also, she doesn't get the highlight foils really close to the hairline so even on the first day, it looked like the roots were already growing back in.  I also asked for just the tiniest trim since I want to grow it out a bit but she ended up taking much more than I'd wanted off.  Also, instead of cutting it, she used a razor which left my hair looking very fly-away and frizzy.  Plus, one side is slightly longer than the other now.  She is very fast - I don't think I've ever been in and out with highlights and a trim in such record time - but the results were not the best.  Also, she didn't consult me about the environmentally friendly colors or about using the razor instead of scissors.  Finally, no credit cards or interac.\",\n",

Little girls stop and stare and adults can't believe that my bright red hair doesn't fade between visits.  Miranda uses organic products, which I didn't consider much of a necessity when I was younger - but as I mature and start to pay more attention to what I put in my body and what I pour into the Earth, I am grateful for.  My hair has been dyed every 2 months on average for the last six years (and we won't talk about all the DIY bleaching that preceded my first visit, which she corrected for me!) but it feels as soft and healthy as virgin hair.  \\n\\nEach visit to her salon is a delight, it's an intimate environment and all the patrons chat with each other and with Miranda, as she quickly and expertly cuts, styles and dyes hair.  She knows & remembers hair and is not afraid to tell you if she thinks something won't suit you - but will also do it anyway if that's what you want! I love Miranda & her work so much that I asked her to style myself and my bridesmaids for my wedding.. something she rarely commits to anymore, and which made me feel lucky to have her accept. \\n\\n(Picture: https://fbcdn_sphotos_g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/s720x720/294083_10150768823645333_6680560_n.jpg) \\n\\nNowadays, going to Miranda's feels more like a social event than the chore I found hair appointments in the past.  We chat, we joke, we trade ideas..  Miranda is a warm and friendly person full of passion for life and her easy spirit will hitch a ride with you as you walk out the door and along Queen street, strutting in the sun with your new haircut! The best part is, she'll leave you with enough money to pick up a new outfit to go with your new look, compared to many Queen street salons.  I could not recommend her enough!

While this is partly because many popular movies don't appeal to me enough to pay $12+ to see, it is also partly because most of the big newer cinemas are all noise and advertising and video games. When I do go out, it is often to one of the smaller or older theatres. The one recent exception has been the Cineplex Odeon Morningside, where I find it is a little more subdued even on Tuesday evenings. It also has one of the lowest ticket pricings in Toronto, probably because it Is pretty far out-of-the-way. Fortunately, I live and work in Scarborough, so it is not too far to travel even by TTC. Additionally, it has the nostalgia bonus of being located across the street from where I lived briefly in the 80s before the plaza was even built.\\n\\nI have been there a few times over the last year, always on their cheap Tuesdays for $6.50 ($9.50 for 3D). I believe the regular daily price is also $9.50, which is about as low as it gets these days. The cinemas themselves are fine; all have good comfortable seating, large screens and digital sound, and they show the same popular movies as elsewhere. I recently watched Star Wars Rogue One in 3D, and last year Star Wars The Force Awakens, and have no complaints about quality compared to other theatres. The only things missing were the noise and crowds of teenagers. I do not recall buying anything from the concessions, but I think the pricing and quality is pretty standard across all Cineplexes.\\n\\nWhile it may not have the same coziness and atmosphere of those old theatres that I grew up with, I think that it does as good a job as I can expect for a decent price, and will probably be back whenever I have a new movie to see that is playing there.\",\n",

Although half of my friends didn\\'t find it scary, the other half did. I did a lot of escape rooms and have seen scarier ones, but for some reason this one really scared me.

While Mayze is \"limited choices, deeper rooms\" - Mayze doesn\\'t have a lot of escape room themes, but each esc room has many more rooms inside....I kept thinking it was the last room, only to find more - very surprised at how big it was, as the building itself looks small from the outside.

I own a VR headset as well and a huge variety of VR games so I'd rather just stay at home and play my own games if I knew I was going to be playing golf and climbing walls for $17. This was definitely a one time thing and I'll probably never return for it again. So not worth it and boring as hell. If the place promotes their establishment as half escape games/half VR arcade, then there's no excuse to why there aren't actual VR games worth playing. It's like walking into a sushi restaurant but instead of getting to eat yummy sushi, you get a mimic cafeteria sushi instead.\\n\\nMy other big peeve was my headphone set. It wasn't working and the person working there made no effort to try and fix it. This left me unable to communicate with the two others that came with me. They also had like at most 5 multiplayer games (boring ones)? And a few co-op and single player games. Honestly, not fun when you're the odd number in a group.

Having said that, it was still a unique experience for the 4 of us.\\n\\nLocation\\nNot sure why all escape room places are so hidden. It's like you have to find the damn place before you can even try to escape lols. Anyhow, I recommend everyone to google map the place first. There should be enough parking spots if you come on a weekend.\\n\\nService\\nThe guys here are pretty nice, super chill I might add. Since they are also learning to set up VR for us, extra time was given for some of the mistakes they made. They gave us a bit of caution before we started that this is new technology for them, so no biggie.\\n\\nVR\\nI'm going to give everyone a big tip here. You will get dizzy. This is in no way the fault of Mayze, because I have been to 2 different places and both times I got a little light-headed. I am warning you now, drink before and after your VR experience. It is essential that you strap that thing on your head as tight as you can. The system that Mayze uses is HTC Vive and you will be playing while standing. I really like how they placed mats on the floor (meaning you are to take off your shoes) and divided each player with curtains. Unlike other VR experiences, they have ventured into the world of multiplayer (which I believe is much more difficult to set up as a business). Overall, it is really fun and you need to be open-minded because it takes some getting used to, time-wise. The guy stayed with us 90% of the time and tried to teach us how to navigate each game. I think that's extra service, and will give them an extra leg in this service area.\\n\\nI don't think VR is for everyone, but it might appeal to individuals who don't even game. I really like the Dodgeball game, easy to pick up, and super fun. There was a climbing game that drove me nuts, so much swinging of the arms lols.

The restaurant is dotted with community mainstays, friends from high school or camp, and relatives you\\'d just rather avoid. Sandwiched tightly in green plastic booths, this is not a place where you can expect to have a private, quiet conversation. In fact, between the bustling bakery up front, and the servers trained by Oscar the Grouch, you can\\'t really expect a quiet anything. \\n\\nBut that\\'s part of United\\'s charm. United Bakers is a Dairy restaurant-the lactose-friendly answer to the old school Delicatessen. Out of respect for Jewish dietary laws, United\\'s menu is limited to dairy, egg and fish-based meals. A polite notice on the website and menu requests that customers refrain from bringing meat on the premises. So if you\\'re expecting bacon and eggs, you\\'re out of luck. Don\\'t worry-you won\\'t miss the bacon. \\n\\nOrdering brunch presents a series of challenges. Egg platters are fine, but omelettes are more interesting. A mushroom version arrives with plenty of thinly-sliced fungi, while good cheddar leaks through the side of a cheese version. Lox, eggs and onions sees properly caramelized onions and chunks of fresh smoked salmon. It doesn\\'t smell fishy, and the lox retains some of it\\'s silky texture since it\\'s not overcooked.  Sides include salad, tomato and cukes (the former still winter-mealy, the latter firm and crisp), and what may be the best undiscovered french fries in Toronto. I suspect they\\'re frozen, but they are consistently crispy and golden outside, and fluffy inside. You also get a choice of bread or bagel. As I always say, GO BAGEL OR GO HOME. \\n\\nLunch and dinner work best when you stick to the basics. Pastas and fish are OK, but most tables opt for a soup and a scoop. United\\'s pea soup deserves it\\'s reputation. Melty peas, chunky veg and the occasional noodle warm the soul. It\\'s a richly flavored soup and a closely guarded secret recipe. I suspect the secret involves a veggie boullion cube, but it works. Bagel platters and sandwiches find their way to most tables along with plates of those fries.  The tuna melt stands out. Piping hot atop a massive twister bagel, it could be shared between two people, along with a cup of that soup. Greek salad deviates from the Platonic ideal, with iceberg lettuce and hardboiled egg but then, it\\'s all buried under so much deliciously creamy feta cheese you probably won\\'t notice. \\n\\nCoffee is fine when it\\'s fresh,  barely drinkable when it\\'s not. I try to time refill requests for when they brew a fresh pot. I\\'d ask politely if they\\'d put a new one on, but value the security of my person.  \\n\\nIt\\'s a bakery, so the best desserts are whatever\\'s fresh. I have a soft spot for the Dobush cake (dry sponge with light-chocolate frosting, enrobed in crackling dark chocolate) and the Apple Bowl (a hot, whole apple wrapped in puff pastry). \\n\\nUnited closes at 9 on weekends, but it\\'s best not to tempt fate. A late night coffee and pastry stop sees our waitress ask repeatedly if she can pack our stale cinnamon buns to go. In another joint, I\\'d walk out and not return.

I enjoyed the dish - simple and definitely filling.  Also tried the Shakshouka - which was eggs dipped in tomato sauce - best eaten with the bagel/bread! \\n\\nOverall,  the chocolate croissant was the highlight of my trip there.  Nice place to try if you're ever around the area for breakfast or brunch :)\",\n",

The shakshouka tasted like chili with eggs that I could have made at home. The pita was ok. \\n\\nThe eggs and lax was marginally better but still bland overall. The bagels were ok but they only gave you butter and jam to put on it, would have been better with some cream cheese. \\n\\nIts nice that you get quick service on the coffee, but the coffee is also flavorless. \\n\\nThe place seems packed, so people must like it, but we left underwhelmed. \\n\\nOne positive sit that the seating inside is nice and they have free parking in the mall complex that they are located in.',\n",

       "  'There are a variety of homestyle food options available at this Jewish dairy diner located in the less than remarkable strip mall that is the Lawrence Plaza. As a dairy diner they uphold the practice to - \"never, never, never, mix milk and mat together!\" and so meat is a no go. They serve your typical fair from sandwiches to, omelets, to lox platters and barley soup. \\n\\nThe pricing ~$9-14, is surprisingly higher than I would expect given the rather lackluster atmosphere, service and general food selection. The dishes are generallly what you\\'d expect your Bubby (grandmother) to serve up on a Sunday afternoon: simple, a bit bland, but it gets the job done. The baked items were the best things here by far and I enjoyed my buttered sesame bagel. Overall, I don\\'t think I\\'d make a habit out of coming back as the few times that I\\'ve eaten here haven\\'t been anything to write home about...(thankfully that\\'s why there\\'s Yelp). You can\\'t really go wrong here, but for tastiness and value points, it misses the mark.',\n",

       "  'Being pescetarian, hungry and pseudo-Jewish, I might be expected to exalt this place. Sadly, I do not.\\n\\nDespite the wonderful dairy restaurant menu, the bagels are underwhelming and the portions are teeny-weeny. The pea soup ($4.89) is delicious but the bowl is what most establishments would call a \"cup\". I can only assume their \"half-bowl\" is a spoonful. What actually IS a spoonful are the sides you receive with the \"platters\" ($9.99-$10.49 for tuna/salmon/whitefish salad). Don\\'t most restaurants practically give away coleslaw and fries just to fill up the plate?\\n\\nTheir cheese blintzes are also good, but if there is a blintz out there that is worth $7 apiece, I haven\\'t met it. And I meet a lot of blintzes.\\n\\nIn summation: United Bakers is an institution, but obviously not for its value. Bring your Bubby, enjoy the lively atmosphere, then go to Gryfe\\'s afterward to fill the rest of your stomach.',\n",
